The study used six soil organic carbon models and ran them under two configurations: with default parameters and with parameters calibrated site-by-site. The results showed that the calibrated multi-model ensemble was able to correctly reproduce soil organic carbon stock changes at the 16 long-term European cropland experiments. The study estimated that annual carbon input will have to increase by 119% compared to the unamended controls to reach a 4‰ objective over 30 years at the experimental sites.",

The dataset offers insights into microbial communities within agricultural soils, providing valuable information for the development of sustainable agricultural strategies and integrated disease management to enhance crop productivity and mitigate environmental stress.",

Here we present two decades of data (1992‑2023) from the Westerfeld long‑term field trial in Central Germany, comprising a strip‑split‑plot design that investigates the interactive effects of tillage (cultivator vs. plough), nitrogen‑fertilization intensity (intensive vs. extensive) and a five‑crop rotation (winter rapeseed, winter barley, winter wheat 1, grain maize, winter wheat 2). The dataset includes standardized measurements of soil physical and chemical properties, detailed crop management records, harvest yields and quality, root traits, plant biochemistry, gene expression, and meta‑barcode derived bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition. The data are intended for meta‑analysis, modelling and AI approaches to improve understanding of how long‑term management shapes soil microbiomes and crop productivity.",

  "abstract": "Erosion of fertile topsoil means severe land degradation and yield loss. Here, we show that reformation of the fertile topsoil and crop yield increase is possible by good agricultural management within a few decades. Evidence relies on a unique long‑term field experiment in NE Germany where the sandy Luvisol was excavated in 1964, topsoil removed or duplicated, and combined with different fertilisation regimes. After 26 years a new fertile topsoil had formed, attaining SOC and aggregate characteristics comparable to reference soils, corresponding to a sequestration of 28 Mg SOC ha⁻¹. The buried former topsoil lost 30–50 % of its SOC over five decades. The study demonstrates that contemporary agricultural tools can rapidly restore degraded arable land and contribute to climate‑change mitigation.",
