    "abstract": "Erosion of fertile topsoil means severe land degradation and yield loss. Here, we show that reformation of the fertile topsoil and crop yield increase is possible by good agricultural management within a few decades. Evidence relies on a unique long‑term field experiment in NE Germany where the sandy Luvisol topsoil was excavated in 1964 and refilled with subsoil material. Undisturbed trials served as controls, combined with no fertilisation, mineral fertilisation or mineral + organic fertilisation. After 26 years a new topsoil with SOC, N stocks and aggregate size distribution comparable to the controls had formed, corresponding to 28 Mg SOC ha⁻¹ sequestration. The former topsoil buried below the plough layer lost 30–50 % of its SOC over five decades. The study demonstrates that current agricultural tools can rapidly restore degraded arable land and contribute to climate‑change mitigation.",
