The quantiﬁcation of these pools has a large impact on modelling results. In this study several methods to estimate inert carbon in soils, based either on total soil organic matter or physical protection, were assessed with the objectives of (1) minimising errors in carbon and nitrogen dynamics and (2) ensuring usability for sites with marked diﬀerences in site conditions. CANDY simulations were carried out by varying solely the method for calculating the size of the inert carbon pool used to initialise the model. Experimental data from Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg were used for the simulation. The data were made available for modellers at a workshop held at Mu¨ ncheberg (Germany) in 2004. The results concerning not only carbon but also nitrogen dynamics were analysed by applying selected statistical methods. It was shown that even in short-term simulations model initialisation procedure may inﬂuence the simulation results considerably. Three methods of estimating inert carbon were identiﬁed as being the most appropriate. These methods are either based on soil texture or pore-space classes and therefore account for the physical protection of soil organic matter. Thus, physical protection seems to be of major importance. By extending the scope of the investigation into nitrogen dynamics, additional support for the applicability of a selected method was obtained. Introduction The simulation model CANDY (Carbon and Nitrogen Dynamics, Franko et al. 1995, 1997; Franko 1996, 1997) has been developed in order to provide information about carbon stocks in soils, organic matter turnover, N uptake by crops, leaching and water quality. A comparison of soil organic carbon models in 1997 showed CANDY to be in the group with the best performance (Smith et al. 1997). In most long-term organic matter models (Hansen et al. 1991; Franko et al. 1995; Coleman and Jenkinson 1996; Parton 1996, etc.), soil or- ganic matter is partitioned in several pools with different turnover rates. In CANDY the decom- posable soil organic matter can be subdivided into biologically active and stabilised soil organic matter. The decomposable and the inert organic matter contribute to the total stock of carbon in the soil. The inert organic matter is considered to be stable and, therefore, does not participate in turnover processes. As in other models (Falloon et al. 2000; Bruun and Jensen 2002) the manner in which CANDY is initialised influences the simulation results con- siderably. Model initialisation may be responsible for the behaviour of a soil as a source or sink of atmospheric CO2 (Falloon and Smith 2000). In order to initialise the CANDY model, a value for decomposable carbon (CDEC) has to be specified by the user. Because it is not possible to measure the decomposable pool directly, in CANDY CDEC can be calculated from the history of the plot and the site-specific turnover conditions, or from the difference between an organic carbon (CORG) measurement and the estimated inert carbon (CI). Thus, the amount of CDEC is affected by uncer- tainties in estimating CI. For example, if decom- posable carbon is too high, the mineralisation of carbon and nitrogen may be overestimated, lead- ing to a misinterpretation of organic matter dynamics and a surplus of mineral nitrogen in soil. In the literature, several methods for calculating the amount of CI are described. They use either the relation between CI and soil texture (Ko¨ rschens 1980; Ko¨ rschens et al. 1998; Ru¨ hlmann 1999) or estimate CI as a part of the whole amount of soil organic carbon (Falloon et al. 1998, 2000). A new approach by Kuka et al. (2006), based on pore- space classes, shows that soil organic matter (SOM) localised in micro-pores is stabilised over a long time. Thus, this part of organic carbon should be very similar to the inert pool of the CANDY model. In the investigation reported here, we tested all of these methods on their applicability for initial- ising the inert carbon pool in the CANDY model. Our objective was to ﬁnd a method which fulﬁls the following criteria: (1) minimises errors in car- bon and nitrogen dynamics and (2) provides usability for sites with marked diﬀerences in site conditions. In order to achieve our objective CANDY simulations were carried out by varying solely the method of estimating the initial value for CI. Simulation results for soil organic carbon and soil mineral nitrogen of the sites (cid:1)Bad Lauchsta¨ dt’ and (cid:1)Mu¨ ncheberg’ were compared with observa- tions. From among the huge number of statistical methods that can be found in literature (Willmott and Wicks 1980; Fox 1981; Addiscott and Whitmore 1987; Loague and Green 1991; Smith et al. 1996, etc.) we used the mean, the root mean square error (RMSE; Fox 1981), the mean bias error (MBE; Addiscott and Whitmore 1987) and the index of agreement (IA; Willmott and Wicks 1980) for comparing predicted and observed val- ues and assessing the CI estimations. Materials and methods CANDY model CANDY consists of a modular system of sub- models and a data base system for model param- eters, initial values, weather data, soil management data and measurement values. The submodels of CANDY are described brieﬂy below and in detail by Franko et al. (1995). In the soil temperature model the heat ﬂow equation is solved based on a statistical approach for the calculation of the soil surface temperature. The hydrological model is based on a capacity approach, and takes into consideration the drain- ing of water by gravitation forces, interception of water by crops, potential and actual evapotrans- piration, surface runoﬀ and snow cover dynamics. The crop model in its standard version consists of parameters describing the temporal develop- ment of crop height, soil cover and rooting depth as piecewise linear functions. Nitrate uptake by plants is calculated by a sigmoidal function for the distribution of the N demand over vegetation time. After harvest, a yield-dependent amount of or- ganic matter from roots and plant residues is recycled to the soil as fresh organic matter with crop-speciﬁc quality parameters. The organic matter turnover model includes the soil nitrogen model. Soil organic matter is subdi- vided in several compartments: up to six diﬀerent pools of added organic matter, two pools of decomposable soil organic matter (one active and one stabilised) and an inert soil organic matter pool, which is independent from climate and agriculture and stays constant over time. Turnover dynamics of all degradable carbon pools follow ﬁrst-order kinetics but are inﬂuenced by soil tem- perature, soil moisture and aeration conditions indicated by soil texture and depth of the soil layer. Nitrogen dynamics are connected to the carbon ﬂuxes via the C/N-ratio of the pools con- cerned. Mineral nitrogen is divided into a nitrate and an ammonium pool. The nitrogen-related processes are: plant uptake, mineral nitrogen input including atmospheric deposition, input of organic manure or plant residues, nitrate leaching, nitriﬁ- cation, denitriﬁcation and mineralisation of soil organic matter leading to nitrogen mineralisation or immobilisation. The model inputs can be classiﬁed as parameters and scenario data. The parameters are: (cid:1) plant development characteristics (standard) – crop height, vegetation time, maximum root depth, etc.; (cid:1) soil data – soil density, particle density, field capacity, permanent wilting point, saturated hydraulic conductivity, amount of clay and silt; (cid:1) organic matter characteristics – C/N-ratio, dry matter content, turnover time, SOM reproduc- tion coefficient. The scenario data include: (cid:1) initial conditions for carbon, nitrogen and soil moisture; (cid:1) agricultural management data – emergence, harvesting, fertilisation, tillage, yield, N-uptake; (cid:1) weather data – precipitation, air temperature and global radiation preferably on a daily basis. Datasets from Bad Lauchsta¨dt and Mu¨ncheberg and simulation with CANDY The datasets from Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (crop rotation) and Mu¨ ncheberg (plot 1) used for the model sim- ulation are described in detail in Franko et al. (2006) and Mirschel et al. (2006). In addition to these data we used the organic carbon measure- ments presented in Table 1. For Mu¨ ncheberg no value at the beginning of the simulation was available. Therefore, the first value in Table 1 was estimated with a trend line using the four measured values. The simulation for both sites has been fitted to meet the starting CORG values. For the mineral nitrogen measurements the reader is referred to Franko et al. (2006) and Mirschel et al. (2006). The simulation period for the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt crop rotation (BL) lasted from 1 September 1996 to 31 December 2003 and at Mu¨ ncheberg plot 1 (MU¨ ) from 1 September 1992 to 31 December chsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg.

Input data such as soil parameters, daily meteorological data and management information were taken from the datasets. In some cases data for the nitrogen uptake by crops, the vegetation time, the carbon input via straw and the C/N-ratio of straw were not speciﬁed but deducible from the datasets. If no data were available or deducible – for example, for C and N input with roots and crop residues – CANDY standard parameters (C/N-ratio, dry matter, rate and synthesis coeﬃ- cients, etc.) were used. The soil parameters for wilting point and ﬁeld capacity were adapted to measurements of soil moisture. In order to initialise the CANDY model, a value for CDEC in soil has to be specified. According to the equation CDEC ¼ CORG (cid:2) CI; ð1Þ with CORG = total organic carbon in soil and CI = inert carbon. CDEC were calculated using the starting CORG values from Table 1 and CI values were calculated with the methods mentioned below. This procedure resulted in five initial values for CDEC. With each initial value a CANDY simulation was started. No other parameters or scenario data were changed. Therefore, differences in simulated carbon and nitrogen dynamics came from the different initial values used. Calculation of inert carbon (CI) (1998) Ko¨ rschens (1980) and Ko¨ rschens et al. found a relationship between CI and the content of clay and fine silt which can be described with the equation: CI-K €O ¼ a (cid:3) b ð2Þ where b is the percentage of soil particles <6 lm and a is usually taken as 0.04. According to Schulz (1997) the regression coefficient a has a range from 0.04 to 0.05. In our investigation we used both 0.04 ( CI-K €OI) and 0.05 ( CI-K €OII) to define the possible range of CI. Ru¨ hlmann (1999) suggested an equation to de- scribe the influence of soil texture on the carbon content of long-term bare fallow soils: the equivalent pore radius Rm (in metres). Rm for the micro-, meso- and macro-pores was set to 5(cid:4)10)8, 10(cid:4)10)8 and 500(cid:4)10)8 m, respectively. Am ¼ 2 (cid:3) Vm Rm ; m 2 micro; meso; macro f g: ð7Þ Considering organic carbon in micro-pores (CI-MIP) as (cid:1)inert’, its amount can be calculated according to the equation: CI(cid:2)R €U ¼ 0:017 (cid:3) c (cid:2) 0:001 (cid:3) expð0:075 (cid:3) cÞ ð3Þ CI-MIP ¼ CORG (cid:3) Amicro Amicro þ Ameso þ Amacro ; ð8Þ where c is the percentage of soil particles <20 lm and CI-R €U (%) is the soil organic carbon content of long-term bare fallow soils which were assumed to be similar to the size of the inert organic carbon pool. Based on Falloon et al. (1998, 2000) CI (ton- ne C per hectare) can be estimated from the total stock of carbon using the following equation (Eq. 4) and its upper (Eq. 5) and lower (Eq. 6) confidence levels: CI-FAL ¼ 0:049 (cid:3) C1:139 ORG CI-FALðþ95Þ ¼ 0:1733 (cid:3) C1:4624 ORG CI-FALð(cid:2)95Þ ¼ 0:01384 (cid:3) C0:8156 ORG ð4Þ ð5Þ ð6Þ where CORG (in tonnes C per hectare) is the total amount of organic C in the soil. An approach to estimate organic carbon in mi- cro-pores based on the hypothesis that the stabil- isation of soil organic matter is a result of its location at places with low biological activity, which in turn is caused by a limitation of oxygen, was suggested by Kuka et al. (2006). In our investigation with the CANDY model the organic carbon in micro-pores is considered to be inert. The total organic carbon is distributed to the diﬀerent pore-space classes – micro-, meso- and macro-pores – according to their surface area. The pore-space classes used (micro, meso and macro) are related to wilting point (WP), ﬁeld capacity (FC) and pore volume (PV), respectively. The in- ner surface area of each pore class is calculated from the volume of the considered pore-space class Vm [WP, FC)WP, PV)FC (in cubic metres)] and with CI-MIP (M.%) mass of carbon in micro-pores, CORG (M.%) mass of total organic carbon in soil and Amicro, meso, macro (in square metres) inner surface of pore class. Statistical methods For this investigation we selected the following statistical methods to obtain information about diﬀerences deriving from varying CI initial values. The root mean square error (RMSE; Fox 1981) and the mean bias error (MBE; Addiscott and Whitmore 1987) provide information about the average difference between predicted (Pi) and ob- served (Oi) values. v u u u t ﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃ n P ðPI (cid:2) OIÞ2 I¼1 n RMSE ¼ ð9Þ MBE ¼ n X I¼1 PI (cid:2) OI n ;n ¼ number of samples: ð10Þ A lower RMSE indicates a more accurate sim- ulation. The lower limit of RMSE is 0. MBE can take positive or negative values. Its calculation does not include a square term, thus, predicted values below and above the observed values cancel out, and the result gives an indication of the bias error. The (cid:1)index of agreement’ (IA) suggested by Willmott and Wicks (1980) is intended to be descriptive and is both a relative and a bounded measure.

Results and discussion Calculated inert carbon The CI values used to calculate initial CDEC values for the simulation of the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg sites and the total organic carbon content are shown in Figure 1. Apart from the remarkable differences in total organic carbon be- tween the two sites, Figure 1 shows that with the CI-FAL method, which is simply based on total CORG, the lowest CI values are obtained. However, the lower and upper confidence levels of CI-FAL cover nearly the whole range of possible inert car- bon. This is in complete agreement with the state- ment of Falloon et al. (1998) (cid:1)that the confidence limits of the model are wide’. For the methods CI-K €OI, CI-K €OII and CI-R €U, which are all based on soil texture and suggest a kind of physical protec- tion of soil organic matter, the following order for both sites was found: CI-R €U\CI-K €OI\CI-K €OII. Whereas, with the new CI-MIP approach the highest inert carbon value of all methods was calculated in the case of the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt site. With respect to the Mu¨ ncheberg site CI-MIP is located between CI-R €U and CI-K €OI. Thus, a clear ranking of the CI-MIP method with respect to the amount of cal- culated inert carbon is not possible. Similar to the CI-K €OI, CI-K €OII and CI-R €U approaches, the CI-MIP approach is suggesting physical protection, but the latter uses pore-space classes instead of soil texture and is also dependent on the total amount of CORG. Therefore, it shows a more dynamic behaviour. For example, changes in pore-space class distribution because of a modified tillage regime result in a dif- ferent CI-MIP value. Simulation results and statistics To give the reader an impression of the model outputs produced with diﬀerent initial CI values, carbon (CORG) for Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg. CI-MIP = Kuka et al. 2006; CI-K €OI and CI-K €OII = Ko¨ rschens 1980 and Ko¨ rschens et al. 1998 with a = 0.04 and 0.05, respectively; CI-R €U = Ru¨ hlmann 1999; CI-FAL= Falloon et al. 1998, 2000. I=Confidence interval for CI-FAL. the simulation results for CORG and NMIN are presented in Figures 2 and 3, respectively. In the case of CORG there is a clear differentiation – increasing with time – between the model runs. The distinct influence of different initial CI values on NMIN in soil, especially for the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt site, emphasises the importance of a careful model initialisation even for short simulation periods. For Bad Lauchsta¨ dt the carbon and nitrogen dynamics and the diﬀerences between the simula- tions are higher than for Mu¨ ncheberg. In addition to mineralisation, this is may be due to other pro- cesses such as leaching or denitriﬁcation. In fact, nitrogen leaching is very low at the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (a) (b) cheberg (b). CI-MIP = Kuka et al. 2006; CI-K €OI and CI-K €OII = Ko¨ rschens 1980 and Ko¨ rschens et al. 1998 with a=0.04 and 0.05, respectively; CI-R €U = Ru¨ hlmann 1999; CI-FAL = Falloon et al. 1998, 2000. site (see Kersebaum et al. 2006) due to a high water storage capacity and low precipitation (see Franko et al. 2006). Thus, the other nitrogen-related pro- cesses have to be adequately taken into account for an assessment of model initialisation. The examination of the mean (mC, mN) and the mean bias error (MBEC, MBEN) for carbon and nitrogen, respectively (Tables 2, 3), indicates that in most cases the observed values are exceeded by the corresponding predicted values. Only for or- ganic carbon and CI-K €OI, CI-R €U and CI-FAL of the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt site an underestimation can be found. For the Mu¨ ncheberg site, the MBEC and MBEN are the lowest for CI-FAL and CI-K €OII, respectively. For Bad Lauchsta¨ dt, the lowest mean bias errors are obtained for CI-K €OI and CI-MIP. Consequently, no method seems to be clearly better than the others in predicting initial values for CI. Looking at the carbon root mean square error (RMSE, Figure 4) for Bad Lauchsta¨ dt, the meth- od for estimating CI proposed by Falloon et al. (1998, 2000) differs clearly from the other CI methods, which account for physical protection of soil organic matter. Obviously, the CI-FAL method underestimates the inert part of soil organic matter for Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (see Figure 1), leading to an overestimation of the decomposable part, followed by a fast decline in soil organic matter and a sur- plus of mineral nitrogen (see Figure 2). For Mu¨ ncheberg there is no substantial difference in RMSEC between any of the methods used in this investigation. In the case of mineral nitrogen, greater differences in the root mean square error can be found. CI-MIP and CI-K €OII are in the leading group for the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt site and, accompa- nied by CI-K €OI, in the leading group for the Mu¨ ncheberg site. The index of agreement (IA, Figure 5) more precisely suggests that for both sites the CI-FAL method decreases in accuracy compared to the others with respect to predict CI in the initialisa- tion of the CANDY model. Falloon et al. (2000) pointed out that their CI method was not expected to be valid for soils with a large CI content. The (cid:1)Haplic Chernozem’ (FAO 1994) of Bad Lau- chsta¨ dt may belong to that category. However, Schmidt et al. (1999) detected charred organic carbon (up to 45% of the bulk organic carbon) in German chernozemic soils. (a) (b) Mu¨ ncheberg (b).

The new CI-MIP approach proves to be as good as CI-K €OI and CI-K €OII. CI-R €U is located between the leading group and CI-FAL. The usefulness of the approach by Ko¨ rschens (1980) and Ko¨ rschens et al. (1998) was also pointed out by Ludwig et al. (2003), however there are some indications that this method is not generally applicable. Problems arise particularly for soils with a very high content of fine particles (FP = clay + fine silt) and low CORG content, a situation that can be found in the long-term experiment from Prague-Ruzyneˇ with FP=41.2% (J. Klir, personal communication) and CI values for the sites Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg. CI-MIP = Kuka et al. 2006; CI-K €OI and CI-K €OII = Ko¨ rschens 1980 and Ko¨ rschens et al. 1998 with a=0.04 and 0.05, respectively; CI-R €U = Ru¨ hlmann 1999; CI-FAL = Falloon et al. 1998, 2000). CORG values from 1.1 to 1.4% (Kubat et al. 2003). Other examples are the long-term experiments of Giessen with CORG=0.99% and FP=25% (Boguslawski and Debruck 1976) and Gembloux with CORG=0.92% and FAT=24% (Droeven et al. 1982). In all these cases the approach by Ko¨ rschens (1980) and Ko¨ rschens et al. (1998) leads to an overestimation of CI. Conclusion Our results show that an important factor in the initialisation procedure is the CANDY model method chosen for the calculation of CI as this will have a strong influence on modelling results, even in short-term simulations. The coupled investiga- tion of carbon and nitrogen dynamics leads to a more secure decision on the applicability of a CI the CI methods considered, method than simply looking at carbon dynamics because an underestimation of inert carbon causes an overestimation of decomposable carbon and a surplus of mineral nitrogen in the soil (or vice versa). Of the CI-FAL method, based simply on total soil organic carbon, is shown to be the least appropriate for a soil with a high amount of inert carbon, such as the Bad Lauchsta¨ dt the CI-K €OI and CI-K €OII methods as well as the new CI-MIP approach, all of which allow for the effects of physical protection of soil organic matter, proved to be successful in estimating the inert or- ganic carbon pool in soils of both of the sites investigated. Hence, physical protection seemed to be of major importance for simulating carbon and nitrogen dynamics.

In contrast to the methods which primarily consider soil texture ( CI-K €OI, CI-K €OII and CI-R €UÞ the CI-MIP approach uses pore-space classes and also includes the total amount of CORG. Changes in pore-space class distribution of one soil, because of a modified tillage or a changed organic manure regime, would result in a different CI-MIP value for the soil. Conseuently, this CI-MIP method is able to express differences in soil structure and organic matter supply at one site. Further studies, with a wider range of soil types and soils with different tillage regimes and soil organic matter levels, are required to see whether the new CI-MIP approach is generally applicable.
