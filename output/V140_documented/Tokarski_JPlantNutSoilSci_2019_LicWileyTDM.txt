Such an assessment for practical land use should consider transformation processes of SOM and its sources of different origin. In this study, we combined a 120-day incubation experiment with thermal decay dynamics of agricultural soils altered by added organic amendments. The aim was to determine the abil- ities and limits of thermal analysis as a rapid approach revealing differences in the degradability of SOM. The carried out experiments based on two independent sampling sets. The first sample set consisted of soil samples taken from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultur- al field experiments (LTAEs), then artificially mixed with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal equal to 60 Mg ha–1 under laboratory conditions. The second sample set based on soil samples of different treatments (e.g., crop type, fertilization, cultivation) in LTAEs at Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg, Germany. Before and after the incubation experiment, thermal mass losses (TML) at selected temperatures were determined by thermogravimetry indicating the degradability of organic amendments mixed in soils. The results confirmed different microbial degradability of organic amendments and SOM under laboratory conditions. Thermal decay dynamics revealed incubation-induced changes in the artificial soil mixtures primarily at TML around 300(cid:2)C in the case of applied straw and sheep faeces, whereas farmyard manure showed mainly changes in TML around 450(cid:2)C. Charcoal did not show significant degradation during in- cubation, which was confirmed by TML. Detailed analyses of the artificial soil mixtures revealed close correlations between CO2-C evolution during incubation and changes in TML at 300(cid:2)C with R2 > 0.96. Results of the soils from LTAEs showed similar incubation-induced changes in thermal decay dynamics for fresh plant residues and farmyard manure. We conclude that the practical assessment of SOM could be facilitated by thermal decay dynamics if modified sample preparation and evaluation algorithms are used beyond traditional peak analysis.

Soil organic matter (SOM) is commonly recognized as the most crucial component of soils determining its physical, chemical and biological properties and ecosystem productiv- ity (Gregorich et al., 2015). SOM is of great importance for the global carbon cycle as a very large store of terrestrial car- bon, which is vulnerable to climate change (Field et al., 2007; Conant et al., 2011). The permanent transformation and min- * Correspondence: D. Tokarski; e-mail: david.tokarski@lks-mbh.com ª 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim www.plant-soil.com Tokarski et al. J. Plant Nutr. Soil Sci. 2019, 182, 729–740 eralization of SOM is dependent on temperature, moisture, soil texture, its composition and other factors (von Lu¨ tzow et al., 2006; Shen et al., 2009). The primary sources of SOM are decomposed plant residues (Weil and Brady, 2016), while in agricultural soils, organic fertilizers are also a major compo- nent (e.g., straw, farmyard manure and charcoal). Organic fertilizers are frequently applied to increase the SOM content, improve biological activity, nutrient availability, soil structure, chemical properties, and crop yields (Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Bending and Turner, 1999; Ko¨ rschens et al., 2013; Schro¨ der et al., 2016). The biological transformation of organic amendments applied to soils is regulated by their chemical composition (Johnson et al., 2007), physical structure (Prescott, 2010), soil texture and quantity as well. They can consist of easily biodegradable or stabilized organic carbon or both (Sarma et al., 2017). For example, straw as a biodegradable organic amendment is decomposed relatively rapidly by microorganisms which is reflected in high degradation rates (Powlson et al., 2011; Han- sen et al., 2016). In contrast, farmyard manure contains both biodegradable and stabilized organic carbon and has longer turnover rates in soil environments (Ko¨ rschens et al., 1994; Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Li et al., 2018a). Another frequently used fertilizer is charcoal, which is characterized by its superi- or stability in soils compared to other organic amendments (Glaser et al., 2002; Kuzyakov et al., 2009; Li et al., 2018b). The assessment of such organic amendments in SOM found increasing attention in the last years, because of their influ- ence on soil organic carbon (SOC) stability and biological transformation processes in soil environments (Mohanty et al., 2011; Plante et al., 2011; Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2018). The complexity of SOM which results from different sources (Fer- reras et al., 2006; Ka¨ tterer et al., 2014), different transforma- tion mechanisms and environmental controls of SOM stabili- zation (Franko and Merbach, 2017) makes the development of methods for assessing biological degradability a challeng- ing task. Recently, artificial mixing of soils with organic sub- stances under laboratory conditions (model experiments) were proposed to substitute previous attempts to develop quality indicators and recovery rates for SOM (Ferna´ ndez- Ga´ lvez et al., 2012; Jin et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2016; Tokarski et al., 2018). However, they are characterized by lim- ited applicability to agricultural practice. Other authors prefer long-term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs) to investigate the long-term impact of SOM on plant nutrition, crop yield, issues (Ko¨ r- and climate change and to focus on practical schens et al., 2013; Dignac et al., 2017). However, these ex- periments are very expensive, long-lived and may not provide necessary answers to farmer’s current questions about the assessment of short-term changes of SOM content, fertilizers and soil management strategies. Therefore, the assessment of the biodegradability of SOM remains an unsolved task (Sa´ nchez et al., 2008). Two simple analytical approaches and their interrelationship have been thoroughly discussed in the past: (1) soil respira- tion as an indicator of microbial stability (Plante et al., 2011; Siewert et al., 2012; Peltre et al., 2013; Pronk et al., 2013) and (2) thermal analysis techniques (e.g., thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis and differential scanning calorim- etry) for rapid determination of soil properties and SOM stabil- ity (Siewert, 2004; Lopez-Capel et al., 2005; Plante et al., 2009; Gregorich et al., 2015; Siewert and Kucˇ erı´k, 2015; Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016; Kristl et al., 2016; Tokarski et al., 2018; Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2018; Souce´ marianadin et al., 2018). Measuring microbial respiration by degradation of SOM dur- ing incubation experiments offers a valuable but very time consuming way to characterize SOM (Paul et al., 2006; Mohanty et al., 2011; Peltre et al., 2013; Nguyen et al., 2016; Schiedung et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2017) and its interactions with minerals (Pronk et al., 2013). This method provides infor- mation about both stabilized and biodegradable fraction of soil organic carbon that is available in soils to heterotrophic organisms (Hopkins, 2007). The long-lasting and expensive experimental procedure, however, limit its application for agri- culture practice. Thermal analysis was used to investigate the biological stabil- ity of SOM, but provided contradictory results in the assess- ment of SOC transformation processes (Otero et al., 2002; Peltre et al., 2013; Kucˇ erı´k and Siewert, 2014; Barros et al., 2016; Schiedung et al., 2017). Nevertheless, the considera- tion of natural soils not influenced by human activities and gentle soil sample preparation with standardized water con- tent opened new opportunities, e.g., for soil property predic- tion (organic carbon, nitrogen, and clay content) and for moni- toring microbial degradation of SOM (Siewert, 2001; Siewert, 2004; Siewert et al., 2012; Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016). Tokarski et al. (2018) detected SOM components in soils independent of clay content using thermal decay dynamics recorded by thermogravimetry. Several authors recommend a considera- tion of the nature and thermal stability of SOM associated with clay (Plante et al., 2005; Hassink, 1997) because it might these findings affect could not answer questions to what extent the degradability of SOM and its components such as organic amendments can be determined considering the content of SOC, clay and factors that regulate SOM accumulation. its microbial degradability. However, This study focuses on the detectability of changes in thermal decay dynamics caused by differences in microbial degrada- tion of SOM in laboratory incubation experiments. The aim of this study was to discover and validate temperature ranges with specific characteristics of the microbial degradability of SOM and organic fertilizers in soils with different clay contents using dynamics of thermal mass losses. 2 Material and methods The thermal decay dynamics of soils from two independent sample sets were recorded before and after 120 days of incu- bation under laboratory conditions.

Soil Sci. 2019, 182, 729–740 Detectability of degradable organic matter 731 2.1 Description of the used soil samples and Long-term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs) experimental design 2.1.1 Characteristics of experimental sites For the study soils were used from three different LTAEs in Germany. The first site is located at the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ) in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (Saxony- Anhalt, 51(cid:2)24¢N, 11(cid:2)53¢E) with a mean annual precipitation of 481 mm and a mean temperature of 8.9(cid:2)C on a silty loam soil developed in loess with a clay content of around 210 g kg–1 soil (Franko and Merbach, 2017). The soil is classified as a Haplic Chernozem (WRB). The second site is situated at the Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops (IGZ) in Grossbeeren (52(cid:2)21¢N, 13(cid:2)19¢E, Brandenburg) with a mean annual precipitation of 521 mm and a mean temperature of 8.4(cid:2)C (Ru¨ hlmann, 2009). The soil is a silty sand with a clay content of around 55 g kg–1 soil and classified as an Arenic- Luvisol (WRB). The third site belongs to the Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) in Mu¨ ncheberg (52(cid:2)30¢N, 14(cid:2)6¢E, Brandenburg) and had a mean annual precipitation of 525 mm and a mean temperature of 8.6(cid:2)C (Barkusky, 2009). The soil is a loamy sand with a clay content of around 50 g kg–1 soil and classified as an Albic Luvisol (WRB). 2.1.2 Soil samples Artificial mixtures with organic amendments under laboratory conditions For the investigation of artificial mixtures of soils with organic amendments, samples of non-fertilized plots of LTAEs in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (Static Fertilization Experiment, established 1902, 16 g SOC kg–1), Grossbeeren (Static Fertilization Experiment, established 1989, 8 g SOC kg–1 soil), and Mu¨ ncheberg (Nutri- tion Increase Experiment, established 1963, 5 g SOC kg–1 soil) were used. Detailed description of the LTAEs were given by Barkusky (2009), Ru¨ hlmann (2009), and Ko¨ rschens and Pfefferkorn (1998). These soil samples were mixed with straw (ST), farmyard manure (FYM), sheep faeces (SF), and char- coal (CC) under laboratory conditions (see details in Tokarski et al., 2018). Each soil was spiked with an equivalent of 60 Mg ha–1 of fresh matter (1.3–7.5 g C kg–1 soil) of all four amendments (n = 12, see Tab. 1). The added quantity of organic amendments represents the highest fertilization rates in these LTAEs (Ko¨ rschens et al., 2013). This sample set consisted of soils from different treatments of LTAEs in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and Mu¨ ncheberg with different long-term organic fertilization and cultivation treatments. From Bad Lauchsta¨ dt we used soil samples of two LTAEs. One LTAE was started in 1983 as Incremental Manure Experiment (V494) to study the impact of high quantities of farmyard manure on yield and soil properties. It includes four different quantities of farmyard manure: 0, 50, 100, and 200 Mg ha–1 y–1 (factor A, four levels) applied to corn and bare fallow (factor B, two crop rotations) with two field repeti- tions (8 treatments, 16 plots, details see in Ko¨ rschens and Pfefferkorn, 1998). Samples were taken from bare fallow and corn treatments without application of farmyard manure (non- fertilized control, 20–23 g SOC kg–1 soil) and with highest application rate of FYM (200 Mg farmyard manure ha–1 y–1 or 40–46 g SOC kg–1 soil). In total, we analyzed eight samples from this LTAE (2 fertilizer levels · 2 crop rotations · 2 field repetitions). The second LTAE was established in 1988 as the Fallow Experiment (V505a) with four field repetitions in order to in- vestigate the impact of (1) mechanical tillage (mechanical bare fallow), (2) herbicide application (chemical bare fallow), (3) combination of mechanical and herbicide bare fallow, and (4) succession of weed flora (self-greening) (Franko and Mer- bach, 2017) on soil properties. The sampling for this study was carried out on treatments with mechanical bare fallow (18 g SOC kg–1 soil) and with succession of weed flora (self- greening) (27 g SOC kg–1 soil) only. A total of eight samples was collected and investigated (2 treatments · 4 field replica- tions). The LTAE in Mu¨ ncheberg is designated as V140 and focuses on the influence of different mineral and organic fertilizers on yield and soil fertility. It was established in a full randomized block design in 1963. The LTAE consist of 8 field repetitions for treatments with different mineral nitrogen levels (40 to 200 kg ha–1 y–1), organic fertilization with farmyard manure (4.8–12.8 Mg ha–1 dry matter every third year) and with straw (4.0 Mg ha–1 dry matter every second year) (Barkusky, 2009). The sample set consisted of four repetitions and included treat- ments with non-fertilization (6 g SOC kg–1 soil), with mineral ni- trogen fertilization (6 g SOC kg–1 soil), with high application of farmyard manure (7 g SOC kg–1 soil), and with straw applica- tion (7 g SOC kg–1 soil) (4 plots · 4 replications = 16 samples).

J. Plant Nutr. Soil Sci. 2019, 182, 729–740 Samples were taken in the second year after straw incorpora- tion, in the first year after application of farmyard manure and after yielding potatoes. 2.2 Sampling and sample preparation All soil samples were taken in autumn 2015 from the selected treatments as a mixed sample (» 30 cores were mixed to gain one composite sample) at a depth of 0–25 cm. The soil sam- ples were immediately gently air dried and sieved to pass a 2-mm screen. In order to create the same conditions of mois- ture equilibrations (comparable contents of bound water), the subsequent sample preparation included storing at 76% rela- tive humidity for at least two weeks (at 22(cid:2)C) in desiccators above saturated NaCl (see details in Siewert, 2001). For the investigations of the artificial soil mixtures, the organic amendments were ground to 0.2 mm particle size (Retsch Ultra Centrifugal Mill ZM 200) after air-drying and, as with the soil samples, stored at 76% relative humidity. After adding organic amendments to the soils, the mixtures were immedi- ately shaken for 2 hours in an airtight glass container at room temperature (22(cid:2)C), and prior to thermogravimetric analyses again conditioned at 76% relative air humidity for 2 weeks (Tokarski et al., 2018). 2.3 Incubation experiments A RESPIROCOND-system (NORDGREEN INNOVATIONS, Sweden) with 96 vessels was used for the incubation experi- ment. The measurement of CO2 is based on changed electri- cal conductivity of a 10 mL solution of 0.6 M potassium hy- droxide by absorbing CO2 in hermetically closed 250-mL ves- sels. Depending on initial SOC content and expected level of CO2 respiration, 20 or 40 g of soils of both sample sets (artificial soil mixtures and soils from LTAEs) in two analytical replica- tions were rewetted under laboratory conditions to 60% of their field water retention capacity (determined at pF = 1.8) just before starting the monitoring of CO2-respiration at a con- stant temperature of 25(cid:2)C. Monitoring of CO2-absorption started immediately after remoistening of soil samples and were repeated every 30 min with prolongation of the time interval to one measurement per hour during 120 days of incubation. The evaluation started with the entire data, but the measurements of the remoistened samples in the first 2.5 hours were excluded for better comparability after full tem- perature adjustment. It includes the transformation of the res- piration rate into g CO2-C per kg soil and g CO2-C per g SOC. 2.4 Thermogravimetric analysis (TG) The TG analyses were carried out in two analytical replicates for each sample before and after the incubation using a Met- tler-Toledo TGA/SDTA 851e device. The air-dried soil sample of 0.8–1.0 g were placed in a ceramic pan and heated with a rate of 5(cid:2)C min–1 from 25(cid:2)C to 950(cid:2)C. The sample mass was recorded every 4 seconds or one measurement for 0.3(cid:2)C tem- perature increase. During the analytical procedure, the sam- ple furnace was purged with an air stream enriched by 76% relative humidity at 22(cid:2)C with a flow rate of » 200 mL min–1. The primary evaluation started with recalculation of mass losses to 1 g of soil and with reduction of data density to one mean thermal mass loss (TML) per 10(cid:2)C temperature in- crease. The thermogravimetric profiles are presented as dif- i.e., ferential TG (DTG) curves, the TML.TML is usually given with lower and upper temperature limit. For example, TML290–300 describes TML from 290(cid:2)C to 300(cid:2)C. the first derivative of 2.5 Organic carbon content determination The organic carbon (OC) contents of the artificial soil mixtures with organic amendments were determined in duplicate from the incubated and non-incubated samples by dry combustion with LECO TruMac CN analyser at an accredited laboratory (LKS mbH, Niederwiesa, Germany) using standard proce- dures (ISO, 1996). 2.6 Statistical analysis the beginning of At the statistical analysis, nonparametric tests were performed to confirm the normal distribution and the lack of interdependence between the factors. Further- more, a multifactorial ANOVA was carried out in order to con- sider the influence of two soil types (factor A), three types of organic amendments (factor B) before and after incubation (factor C) on measured parameters (incubation experiments: g CO2-C per kg soil; thermal mass losses: mg per g soil in 10(cid:2)C temperature increase; OC content: g C per kg soil). In addition, the results were verified by paired t-tests and modi- fied ANOVA analyses. The significance levels (p < 0.001, p < 0.01 or p < 0.05) are given in the text. The Tukey HSD test was applied to compare selected means from main and combination effects. Linear correlation analyses were performed to describe the relation- ships between TML and CO2-C evolution. Presented signifi- cant data have a probability of at least of 95% (R2 > 0.6). All statistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA(cid:2) soft- ware (version 12.0) or Microsoft Excel(cid:2) (2013). All tests were repeated in R-statistics (version 3.2.1) for validation of the results. 3 Results 3.1 Incubation-induced changes in artificial soil mixtures with organic amendments with time in soils spiked with different organic amendments (p < 0.001 by Tukey-HSD test; Tab. 2a). The non-treated soils showed the lowest CO2-C evolution without significant differ- ences between sites (p > 0.05, data not shown) and without differences to samples spiked with CC and FYM. The CO2-C evolution for all amendments increased in following order: non-treated soil £ CC £ FYM < SF < ST.

As an example, soils in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (BL) characterized by an initial SOC content of 16.1 g kg–1 (dotted black line). The application of ST (adding of 4.6 g C kg–1 soil) should increase the OC content ap- proximately to 20.7 g C kg–1 soil. The measured OC content was 21.8 g C kg–1 soil (black column in Fig. 2; p < 0.001). The 120-day incubation of the soil with added ST decreased the OC content by 3.1 g C kg–1 soil to 18.7 g C kg–1 soil (dashed black column, p < 0.001). The increase in OC content after the addition of or- ganic amendments was significant in all cases (Tokarski et al., 2018), while the reduction by incubation was significant only for ST, FYM and SF (Fig. 2, Tab. 2b). at The dynamics of TML of the non- treated soil in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt were distinguished from the soil in Mu¨ n- cheberg by higher TML (Fig. 3). This difference corresponds to dif- ferences in clay content and carbon accumulation of both soils. Adding straw increased the TML on both sites between temperatures 250(cid:2)C and 500(cid:2)C and with a peak at » 330(cid:2)C (p < 0.001). Incubation re- duced the TML in same temperature range with a peak at » 330(cid:2)C (p < 0.01). In temperature ranges below 200(cid:2)C, peak shifts appear to type.

(self-greening, In Mu¨ ncheberg, the treatments with- out fertilization and with mineral nitrogen (N) application indicated lowest values compared to samples with FYM (p < 0.001) and straw (p < 0.05 compared to non-fertilized plots only). Nevertheless, a site in- fluence (clay content) was verified by higher values in Mu¨ ncheberg Lauchsta¨ dt compared to Bad (p < 0.001, Fig. 5, small insets). experiments in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (BL, black), Grossbeeren (GB, dark grey), and Mu¨ ncheberg (Mu¨ , pale grey) each spiked with 60 Mg ha–1 fresh matter of straw (ST), sheep faeces (SF), farmyard manure (FYM), and charcoal (CC) before and after 120 days of laboratory incubation. Horizontal dotted lines indicate the initial soil organic carbon contents of non-treated soils from LTAE-plots without fertilization. We found significantly larger chang- es in TML between 200 and 500(cid:2)C for FYM with corn compared to bare fallow (Fig. 6a). Incubation had less influence on TML, which varied with the investigated temperature range. Therefore, minor changes occurred in treatments with FYM and corn in TML at » 330(cid:2)C (no significant), while a significant reduction after incubation can only be observed at » 450(cid:2)C (p < 0.001). Self-greening produced larger TML between 200 and 550(cid:2)C (with a peak at » 330(cid:2)C) compared to mechanical bare fallow (Fig. 6b). Incubation led to a reduc- tion in TML mainly at » 330(cid:2)C (p < 0.01) for self-greening. In treat- ments with mechanical fallow, the incubation-induced chang- es were particularly visible in TML at » 450(cid:2)C (increase, p < 0.001). with added straw (60 Mg ha–1 fresh matter or 4.6 g C kg–1 soil) before incubation (bold solid lines) and after incubation (dotted lines) compared to non-treated soils (thin solid lines). with a reduced mass loss intensity. The effects of CC were oc- curred mainly above 450(cid:2)C (not significant). In addition, correlation analyses of the artificial soil mixtures confirmed close relationships between the measured CO2-C evolution and the incubation-induced changes in TML (differ- ences in TML before and after incubation). For example, CO2-C evolution during incubation experiments correlates with TML at 300(cid:2)C (R2 = 0.96) (similarly as in Kucˇ erı´k and Siewert, 2014) and with TML at 410(cid:2)C (R2 = 0.95). In Figure 7a, samples with FYM (black solid line) are charac- terized by larger TML between 250 and 450(cid:2)C compared to non-fertilized treatments (dotted grey line). Incubation re- duced the influence of FYM (Fig. 7b) in TML with two peaks at » 390(cid:2)C (p < 0.01) and at » 450(cid:2)C (p < 0.05). The addition of straw (grey solid line, Fig. 7a) did not cause an increase in TML compared to the non-fertilized treatments (dotted grey ª 2019 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Aside from mineralization during incuba- tion, the added organic amendments in- creased the OC content in soils (Tab. 2b). Dynamics of TML mirrored these changes in OC content caused by both adding amendments (Tokarski et al., 2018) and their incubation in soils (Figs. 2 and 3). Main differences in CO2-C evolution and OC content between sites (LTAEs) can be explained with interdependency between content of SOC and clay (Hassink, 1997; Ko¨ rschens and Pfefferkorn, 1998; Bar- kusky, 2009; Ru¨ hlmann, 2009; Franko and Merbach, 2017). Similar results can be found in the inset of Fig. 1, where microbio- logical degradation is expressed in incuba- tion experiments in g CO2-C per g SOC. However, a dependence of the biological degradation of the added organic amend- ments on the clay content of the soil is not proved. Because the CO2-C evolution per kg soil was very similar at all sites (LTAEs, mineralization from organic amendments can be concealed by the established clay- dependent organic carbon accumulation in soils or by carbon protection mechanisms. These considerations challenge the as- sessment of the biodegradability of SOM. lines) presented as mean values of all sites (Bad Lauchsta¨ dt, Grossbeeren, Mu¨ ncheberg) and artificial soil mixtures presented as mean values of all sites before incubation (black bold solid lines) and after incubation (black dotted lines).

In case of N and non-ferti- lization, no significant changes in TML before and after incu- bation were found. In the carried out experiments with both sample sets, the recording of thermal de- cay dynamics reveal changes in SOM by the addition of organic fertilizers to different soils in temperature ranges between 200 and 550(cid:2)C. Microbiological degradation changes TML in same temperature ranges (Figs. 4, 6, and 7). This temperature area is known for thermal decomposition of organic matter (Plante et al., 2009; Me´ ndez et al., 2013; Pallasser et al., 2013). Correlation analyses of the soils from LTAEs revealed close relationships between CO2-C evolution in incubation experi- ments and incubation-induced changes in TML.

Summarizing these results, TML at » 300(cid:2)C seems to be an indicator for biodegradable organic residues in agricultural soils (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2013). Furthermore, this indicator is close to TML for predicting carbon con- tents (e.g., TML320–330; Siewert, 2004), which reflects a clay-depend- ent carbon accumulation. For this reason, TML » 300(cid:2)C as an indica- tor for biodegradable components can be influenced by clay depend- ent organic carbon accumulation and requires a separate evaluation to distinguish freshly added carbon from clay- (organic amendments) dependent accumulated carbon. The addition of sheep faeces (artifi- cial soil mixtures) led to minor chang- es in CO2-C evolution and in dynam- ics of TML compared to straw. This can be explained by lower quantity of added carbon and lower dry mat- ter content (Tokarski et al., 2018). However, the incubation-induced changes in thermal decay dynamics were observed in larger temperature ranges with less pronounced focus on TML at » 300(cid:2)C. These specifics could indicate a mixture of both bio- degradable (e.g., fresh forage) and stabilized organic components in result of its origin (e.g., digestion). fertilization treatments from three long-term agricultural field experiments in (a) Bad Lauchsta¨ dt and (b) Mu¨ ncheberg.

However, the incubation of soils of the LTAE in Mu¨ n- cheberg with long-term straw application (soils from LTAEs, cial soil mixtures. These results, however, can be explained with the high degradability of straw (Powlson et al., 2011, Hansen et al., 2016), with its low application rate (4 Mg ha–1 every second year), and with sampling of soils in the second year after straw application. The LTAEs in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt did not contain any treatments with straw. However, corn and succession of weed flora (self- greening) seem to have similar impact as straw on both CO2-C evolution and dynamics of TML with focus on temper- atures » 300(cid:2)C (Fig. 6). If one considers the mineral nitrogen Farmyard manure in artificial soil mixtures caused even small- er changes in CO2-C evolution compared to straw and sheep faeces. The repeated application of farmyard manure in LTAEs showed a higher influence with different impacts on CO2-C evolution in Mu¨ ncheberg and Bad Lauchsta¨ dt. A lower effect in artificial soil mixtures can be explained by the small quantity of added carbon and as a result of the lower dry mat- ter content compared to straw, for example. The site-depend- ent influence on CO2-C evolution of soils from LTAEs may be caused by the different quantities of added fertilizers (Bad Lauchsta¨ dt: 200 Mg ha–1 per year; Mu¨ ncheberg: 12 Mg ha–1 every three years). In both sample sets, changes in dynamics of TML caused by the addition and incubation of farmyard manure are located at the same temperature interval of 200 to 500(cid:2)C.

FYM = farmyard manure. emphasis on TML » 300(cid:2)C may result from a lower proportion of biodegradable components due to di- gestion and humification processes during storage of this fertilizer (Ouatmane et al., 2000; Sa´ nchez et al., 2008). This special feature of farmyard man- ure reflects a better comparability with SOM char- acteristics compared to other organic fertilizers (Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Lima et al., 2009). This challenges the detection of farmyard manure using thermal decay dynamics (Tokarski et al., 2018) and underlines the necessity of distinguishing between different SOM components for their assessment in land use. It provokes again questions to what extent organic amendments and clay content influ- ence carbon accumulation in soils (Palm et al., 2014). Charcoal as an example for black carbon is distin- guished from other organic amendments by higher thermal stability (Leifeld, 2007; Plante et al., 2009; Cimo` et al., 2014) and low biological degradability (Atkinson et al., 2010; Cayuela et al., 2014; Grun- wald et al., 2016; Sarma et al., 2017). This particularity of charcoal explains the lack of significant changes in CO2-C evolution notwith- standing the high quantity of added carbon. Never- theless, charcoal seems to be traceable in artificial soil mixtures using TML above 450(cid:2)C (Tokarski et al., 2018). The different levels of correlation coefficients be- tween CO2-C evolution and TML for both artificial soil mixtures and soils from LTAEs can be ex- plained by the differing proportion of added, de- graded or accumulated organic components of SOM (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016; Tokarski et al., 2018). Studies by Peltre et al. (2013) showed similar trends in changing diagnostic temperatures which were explained by different protective mechanisms of SOM and their interaction with soil minerals. In summary, a combined evaluation of thermogra- incubation vimetric analyses before and after seems to provide information about biodegradation processes of SOM. However, overlapping TML’s caused by organic amendments (e.g., fresh resi- dues or fertilizers) and SOM (clay-dependent accumulated carbon) requires adopted evaluation approaches. A possible approach could be the use of thermal mass losses in larger predefined tem- perature ranges (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2018) which can combine traditional fractionation of SOM with mod- ern approaches such as density fractionation and mass spectroscopy for SOM quality determination (Wiesmeier et al., 2014; Schiedung et al., 2017).

J. Plant Nutr. Soil Sci. 2019, 182, 729–740 thermo-oxidative fractions, this study hints on a detectability of microbial degradation processes via recording of thermal mass losses in two independent experiments. However, these conclusions are based on methods for the assessment of thermal decay dynamics that go beyond the application of traditional peak analysis. Suitable reference objects are needed to compensate for the variety of unknown overlapping thermal degradation processes and to develop necessary evaluation algorithms. The conditioning of air-dried soil sam- ples at comparable humidity and the content of bound water or clay in soil samples should be considered as a prerequisite to detect the interactions between thermal and biological de- gradability of SOM and its components. Such sample prepa- ration may support the indirect distinction between soil organ- ic carbon and organic carbon of fresh plant residues, organic fertilizers or other origin (e.g., charcoal) for the future assess- ment of SOM.
