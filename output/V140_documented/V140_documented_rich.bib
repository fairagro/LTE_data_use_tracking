 abstract = {Mid-term (MTEs, 5–20 years) and long-term (LTEs, 20+ years) field experiments are key sources of information to design future climate-smart agriculture. Within the European Joint Program SOIL (EJP SOIL), we built the EJP SOIL-MTE/LTE metadataset that contains metadata from 240 MTEs/LTEs across Europe. Metadata collected included precise descriptions of the treatments (combination of factors such as tillage, crop type/rotation, amendments/fertilizers, grazing and pest/weed management), soil and crop measurements and pedo-climatic information. Using different figures and dashboards, an overview of those MTEs/LTEs is presented and specific research themes (tillage systems, residue management, amendment type and cover crops) are further analysed within their pedo-climatic context. An interactive web portal developed in collaboration with the BonaRes project (https://lte.bonares.de), enables users to explore the metadataset and find relevant MTEs/LTEs for specific combinations of practices (e.g. all MTEs/LTEs that investigate cover crops on a Cambisol in no-tillage system). Finally, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the metadataset was carried out to highlight the potential contribution of MTEs/LTEs to a harmonized European soil observation and monitoring approach. We propose that the metadataset could be elaborated with metadata from other existing MTEs/LTEs in Europe or even worldwide.},

@article{bruni_multimodelling_2022,
 abstract = {Soils store vast amounts of carbon (C) on land, and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks in already managed soils such as croplands may be one way to remove C from the atmosphere, thereby limiting subsequent warming. The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4‰ at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site-by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 ± 1.2 Mg C ha−1 year−1 to increase SOC stocks by 4‰ per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median ± median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing SOC stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi-model ensembles when predicting SOC stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition. Highlights: The feasibility of the 4‰ target was studied at 16 long-term agricultural experiments. An ensemble of soil organic carbon models was used to estimate the uncertainty of the predictions. On average across the sites, carbon input had to increase by 119% compared to initial conditions. High uncertainty of the simulations was mainly driven by water-related variables.},

 abstract = {Erosion of fertile topsoil means severe land degradation and yield loss. Here, we show that reformation of the fertile topsoil and crop yield increase is possible by good agricultural management within a few decades. Evidence relies on a unique long-term field experiment in NE Germany, where in 1964 the sandy soil (Luvisol) had been excavated to 52 cm and refilled with subsoil material of 52 cm thickness. Undisturbed trials served as controls, these were all combined with either no fertilisation, mineral fertilisation or a combined mineral and organic fertilisation. It took only 26 years until new topsoil had been formed. Its soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks and the aggregate size distributions equalled that of the other treatments; SOC sequestration corresponded to 28 Mg SOC ha−1. The former topsoil buried below the plough layer lost 30–50 percent of its SOC during 5 decades in a non-linear manner. We conclude that our current agricultural tools can restore degraded arable land rather fast and contribute to climate change mitigation through a significant SOC sequestration as well.},

@article{donmez_climate_2023,
 abstract = {CONTEXT: Long-Term Field Experiments (LTEs) were implemented to study the long-term effects of different management practices, including tillage, fertilization and crop rotation under otherwise constant conditions. Climate change is expected to change these conditions, challenging interpretation of LTE data with regard to the distinction between climate change and management effects. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to quantify the expected, spatially differentiated changes of agroclimatic conditions for the German LTE sites as a precondition for modelling and LTE data interpretation. METHODS: We developed a framework combining spatially distributed climate data and LTE metadata to identify the possible climatic changes at 247 LTE sites with experiments running for 20 years or more. The LTEs were classified using the following categories: fertilization, tillage, crop rotation, field crops or grassland, conventional or organic. We utilized climate variables (temperature, precipitation) and agroclimatic indicators (aridity, growing degree days, etc.) to compare a baseline (1971–2000) with future periods (2021−2100) under the IPCC's Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP). A comprehensive LTE risk assessment was conducted, based on changes in climate variables and agroclimatic indicators between baseline and future scenarios. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under the most extreme scenario (SSP585), 150 LTEs are expected to shift from humid and dry sub-humid to semi-arid conditions. Frost days in LTE areas are expected to decline by 81%, and the growing season to lengthen by up to 92%. The spatial differentiation of expected climate change also facilitates the identification of suitable sites for future agricultural practices and may inform the design of new LTEs. SIGNIFICANCE: Our results may guide the interpretation of LTE data regarding the effect of climate change, facilitating future soil crop modelling studies with LTE data and providing information for planning new LTE sites to support future agricultural research and/or adapting management on existing LTE sites. The framework we developed can easily be transferred to LTE sites in agricultural regions worldwide to support LTE research on climate change impacts and adaptation.},

@article{ellerbrock_functional_1999,
 abstract = {The composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is influenced by land use and fertilization. We studied changes in the SOM in a long-term field experiment on a sandy Podzoluvisol. The control plot and four combinations of manurial treatments of the experiment were selected: one with mineral fertilizer only and three combinations of organic manure with mineral fertilizer: cattle manure + NPK, cattle manure + PK and straw + NPK. The SOM was extracted by sodium pyrophosphate solution (pH = 10) and hot water (100°C). The extracts were analysed by Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The FT-IR spectra from sodium pyrophosphate extracts indicate that composition of SOM is indeed influenced by different fertilization. The C=O band at 1710 cm-1 in the samples of the plots fertilized with cattle manure has the highest absorption intensity, whereas the material from the plot fertilized with straw + NPK has the least intense. The GPC analyses of the extracts showed that adding cattle manure +NPK increased the molecular size of SOM in comparison with the control plot. The analysis of hot-water extracts with FT-IR showed no significant differences in functional groups, but GPC chromatograms distinguished features in molecular size distribution. Fertilization with cattle manure increased the molecular size of the SOM in comparison with the control, but the differences in content of carboxylic groups and molecular weight were detected in sodium pyrophosphate extracts only.},

@article{gocke_interactive_2023,
 abstract = {Crop production often leads to soil organic carbon (SOC) losses. However, under good management practice it is possible to maintain and even re-accumulate SOC. We evaluated how different cropland management techniques affected SOC stocks in the topsoil (0–30 cm depth) of 10 long-term experiments (LTE) in Germany. We found that SOC stocks were particularly enhanced by mineral fertilization and organic amendments like straw incorporation and to a smaller degree by irrigation, but only slightly affected by the choice of preceding crops. In agreement with global meta-analyses, liming and reduced tillage had little or even negative effects on SOC storage, but effects also depended on fertilization. Management effects on SOC stocks were dependent on soil texture: sandy soils showed the lowest SOC stocks of 20.9 ± 2.3 (standard error of the mean) Mg ha−1, but exhibited the largest relative response to different management options. Annual changes in SOC stocks ranged from −3.0 ‰ with no mineral N fertilization, to + 6.1 ‰ with farmyard manure application, using the mineral-fertilized and limed treatment as reference. Even higher rates of up to + 10.6 ‰ yr−1 were reached with the combination of irrigation and straw incorporation. Note that the contribution of organic amendments to SOC accrual and thus to climate change mitigation must be adjusted for reduction in SOC at sites from which straw was removed. Overall, the potential of agricultural management to influence and enhance SOC stocks is significant. This potential is controlled by soil type and land-use duration, is largest for sandy soils with overall lowest SOC stocks, and is characterized by antagonistic and synergistic effects of different management practices.},

@article{grahmann_dilemma_2023,
 abstract = {Long-term experiments (LTEs) have provided data to modellers and agronomists to investigate changes and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different cropping systems. As treatment changes have occurred due to agricultural advancements, so too have analytical soil methods. This may lead to method bias over time, which could affect the robust interpretation of data and conclusions drawn. This study aims to quantify differences in SOC due to changes in dry combustion methods over time, using soil samples of a LTE established in 1963 that focuses on mineral and organic fertilizer management in the temperate zone of Northeast Germany. For this purpose, 1059 soil samples, collected between 1976 and 2008, have been analysed twice, once with their historical laboratory method right after sampling, and a second time in 2016 when all samples were analysed using the same elementary analyser. In 9 of 11 soil sampling campaigns, a paired t-test provided evidence for significant differences in the historical SOC values when compared with the re-analysed concentrations of the same LTE sample. In the sampling years 1988 and 2004, the historical analysis obtained about 0.9 g kg−1 lower SOC compared with the re-analysed one. For 1990 and 1998, this difference was about 0.4 g kg−1. Correction factors, an approach often used to correct for different analytical techniques, could only be applied for 5 of 11 sampling campaigns to account for constant and proportional systematic method error. For this particular LTE, the interpretation of SOC changes due to agronomic management (here fertilization) deviates depending on the analytical method used, which may weaken the explanatory power of the historical data. We demonstrate that analytical method changes over time present one of many challenges in the interpretation of time series data of SOC dynamics. Therefore, LTE site managers need to ensure providing all necessary protocols and data in order to retrace method changes and if necessary recalculate SOC. Highlights: A total of 1059 LTE soil samples taken between 1976 and 2008 were re-analysed for SOC in 2016 Several methodological changes for SOC determination led to significant different SOC concentration in the same sample Interpretation and time series of LTE soil data suffer from consideration of analytical method changes and poor documentation of the same Soil archive establishment, thorough method protocols and diligent proficiency testing after soil method changes ameliorate the dilemma.},

@article{hijbeek_nitrogen_2018,
 abstract = {Nitrogen (N) supply from organic amendments [such as farmyard manure (FYM), slurries or crop residues] to crops is commonly expressed in the amendment’s Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV). Values for NFRV can be determined by comparison of crop yield or N uptake in amended plots against mineral fertiliser-only plots. NFRV is then defined as the amount of mineral fertiliser N saved when using organic amendment-N (kg/kg), while attaining the same crop yield. Factors known to affect NFRV are crop type cultivated, soil type, manuring history and method or time of application. We investigated whether long-term NFRV depends on N application rates. Using data from eight long term experiments in Europe, values of NFRV at low total N supply were compared with values of NFRV at high total N supply. Our findings show that FYM has a significant higher NFRV value at high total N supply than at low total N supply (1.12 vs. 0.53, p = 0.04). For the other amendment types investigated, NFRV was also higher at high total N supply than at low total N supply, but sample sizes were too small or variations too large to detect significant differences. Farmers in Europe usually operate at high rates of total N applied. If fertiliser supplements are based on NFRV of the manure estimated at low total N supply, N fertiliser requirements might be overestimated. This might lead to overuse of N, lower N use efficiency and larger losses of N to the environment.},

The included LTEs from 17 sites are the responsibility of institutional members of the International Working Group of Long-term Experiments in the IUSS. Between the sites, average annual temperatures differ between 8.1 and 15.3°C, annual precipitation between 450 and 1400 mm, and soil clay contents between 3 and 31%. On average of 350 yield comparisons, combined mineral and organic fertilization resulted in a 6% yield benefit compared with mineral fertilization alone; in the case of winter wheat, the smallest effect was 3%, the largest effect, seen with potatoes, was 9%. All unfertilized treatments are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC), varying between 0.36 and 2.06% SOC. The differences in SOC in unfertilized plots compared with the respective plots with combined mineral (NPK) and organic (10 t ha-1 farmyard manure) fertilization range between 0.11 and 0.72%, with an average of 0.3% (corresponding to ∼15 t ha-1). Consequently, the use of arable soils for carbon sequestration is limited and of low relevance and merely depleted soils can temporarily accumulate carbon up to their optimum C content. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

A suitable possibility for this quantification is the analysis of long-term field experiments, because the carbon and nitrogen contents are continuously measured on those sites, according to the principle of ceteris paribus, over long periods often comprising several decades. For the present study, the results of 15 long-term field experiments on ten different sites with 150 different variations of fertilization were evaluated. The duration of the experiments was between 40 and 110 years (with one exception). The data of the Corg-contents were studied almost complete within a period of 20 years while the contents of Nt were considered within six experiments. The results of the 15 long-term field experiments reveal that on all variants with combined organic-mineral fertilization in the order of magnitude according to the "best practice" and the "method of balance of humus", no depletion of the Corg-contents was detected. Instead, we found a significant increase in various cases. Also in the case of the Nt-contents, no depletion could be detected. A large number of analyses and studies dealing with long-term field experiments of other authors support those results. © 2014 Taylor & Francis.},

 abstract = {Using data from long-term experiments at the Loess-Chernozem site, Bad Lauchstädt und 12 other European sites, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils, the determination of decomposable soil organic matter (SOM), the effect on yield of SOM as well as carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Both C and N in SOM have to be divided into an inert and a decomposable fraction. The inert C is strongly correlated with clay content, while most changes in both C and N occur in the readily decomposable fraction. In the experiments considered the latter ranges between 0.2 to 0.6% C and 0.02 to 0.06 % N. The annual changes of the Corg content amount only to about 0.01% Corg corresponding to 500 kg/ha, even under extreme changes of the fertilizing system. Hot water extractable C (Chwe) has proved to be an appropriate criterion for the calculation of the decomposable C and thus for the N release from soil. Different methods to maintain a SOM balance are compared and first guideline values for an agronomically and ecologically justified SOM content of arable soils are recommended. In arable soils the exceeding of an upper Corg value influences neither crop yield nor the C and N balance in a positive way. In terms of ecology and environment, set-aside-programmes or fallows in a crop rotation affect the balances negatively. Atmospheric N deposition can amount to about 50 kg/ha·yr. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1998.},

@article{post_integrated_2007,
 abstract = {A process-based extension of the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model) to simulate selected environmental change impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics for environmental conditions in meso- to macro-scale river basins is proposed. The novel aspect and main advantage of the extended model is an integrated consideration of hydrological processes, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical cycles (soil carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen) in semi-closed systems (river basins) under environmental change. Thereby the extension was designed to integrate present-day understanding of soil organic matter dynamics under the constraints of data availability for parameterisation at the regional scale. A major advantage is less data and parameter necessary to run the model compared to state of the art SOC models and the availability of direct measurements of soil C carbon contents to test and validate the model. The model extension was tested regarding primary organic matter decomposition and long-term SOC dynamics using observed data sets. This test delivered similar quality as other SOC models. The new SOC model extension adequately represents these processes when compared to observed data on experimental field sites and literature studies. Application of the extended model to assess impacts of land management practices (different organic and inorganic fertilisation schemes, different crop rotations, inclusion of cover crops and harvest by-product returns) on long-term SOC dynamics is presented here at the experimental field and river basin scale. The simulated quantification at the field scale of different fertilisation regimes led to changes from -0.13 to +0.1 t C ha-1 year-1 in SOC, different types of crop rotations and cover crop impacts changed SOC between -0.13 and +0.07 t C ha-1 year-1 and incorporation of harvest by-products (grain straw residuals) led to changes between -0.1 and +0.027 t C ha-1 year-1 in SOC. It is shown on the river basin scale that harvest by-products quantity remaining on the field significantly impact regional SOC dynamics (loss of 0.26 t C ha-1 year-1 when exporting all harvest by-products). The modelled results are in general agreement with studies reported in literature. The extended model is hence able to quantify the impacts of selected land management practices on long-term SOC dynamics and allows land management practices and their impacts on water availability, water quality, carbon storage in soils, and vegetation growth to be assessed in an integrated way. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{post_parameter_2008,
 abstract = {The use of integrated soil organic matter (SOM) models to assess SOM dynamics under climate change, land use change and different land management practices require a quantification of uncertainties and key sensitive factors related to the respective modelling framework. Most uncertainty studies hereby focus on model parameter uncertainty, neglecting other sources like input data derived uncertainties, and spatial and temporal properties of uncertainty. Sources of uncertainties assessed in this study stem from uncertainties in model parameterisation and from uncertainties in model input data (climate, soil data, and land management assumptions). Thereby, Monte Carlo based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using a latin hypercube stratified sampling technique was applied to derive plot scale (focusing on temporal propagation) and river basin scale propagation of uncertainty for long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. The model used is the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which has been extended by a process-based multi-compartment model for SOM turnover. Results obtained by this study can be transferred and used in other simulation models of this kind. Uncertainties resulting from all input factors used (model parameters + model input data) show a coefficient of variation between 5.1 and 6.7% and accounted for ± 0.065 to ± 0.3% soil carbon content (0.06-0.15 t C ha-1 yr-1). Parameter derived uncertainty contributed most to overall uncertainty. Concerning input data contributions, uncertainties stemming from soil and climate input data variations are striking. At the river basin scale, cropland and forest ecosystems, loess and gleyic soils possess the highest degree of uncertainty. Quantified magnitudes of uncertainty stemming from the examined sources vary temporally and spatially due to specific natural settings (e.g. climate, land use and soil properties) and deliver useful information for interpreting simulation results on long-term soil organic carbon dynamics under environmental change. Derived from this analysis, key sensitive model parameters and interactions between them were identified: the mineralization rate coefficient, the carbon use efficiency parameter (synthesis coefficient) along with parameters determining the soil temperature influence on SOM turnover (mainly Q10 value) and the soil input related data (soil bulk density and initial soil C content) introduced the highest degree of model uncertainty. The here gained information can be transferred to other process-based SOM turnover models to consider stronger most crucial parameters introducing highest uncertainty contribution to soil C storage assessment under changing environmental conditions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{puhlmann_comparison_2006,
 abstract = {Almost all soil organic carbon turnover models rely on a partitioning of total organic carbon into an inert and a decomposable pool. The quantification of these pools has a large impact on modelling results. In this study several methods to estimate inert carbon in soils, based either on total soil organic matter or physical protection, were assessed with the objectives of (1) minimising errors in carbon and nitrogen dynamics and (2) ensuring usability for sites with marked differences in site conditions. CANDY simulations were carried out by varying solely the method for calculating the size of the inert carbon pool used to initialise the model. Experimental data from Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg were used for the simulation. The data were made available for modellers at a workshop held at Müncheberg (Germany) in 2004. The results concerning not only carbon but also nitrogen dynamics were analysed by applying selected statistical methods. It was shown that even in short-term simulations model initialisation procedure may influence the simulation results considerably. Three methods of estimating inert carbon were identified as being the most appropriate. These methods are either based on soil texture or pore-space classes and therefore account for the physical protection of soil organic matter. Thus, physical protection seems to be of major importance. By extending the scope of the investigation into nitrogen dynamics, additional support for the applicability of a selected method was obtained. © Springer 2006.},

@article{puppe_crop_2021,
 abstract = {Due to the fact that silicon (Si) increases the resistance of plants against diverse abiotic and biotic stresses, Si nowadays is categorized as beneficial substance for plants. However, humans directly influence Si cycling on a global scale. Intensified agriculture and corresponding harvest-related Si exports lead to Si losses in agricultural soils. This anthropogenic desilication might be a big challenge for modern agriculture. However, there is still only little knowledge about Si cycling in agricultural systems of the temperate zone, because most studies focus on rice and sugarcane production in (sub)tropical areas. Furthermore, many studies are performed for a short term only, and thus do not provide the opportunity to analyze slow changes in soil–plant systems (e.g., desilication) over long periods. We analyzed soil and plant samples from an ongoing long-term field experiment (established 1963) in the temperate zone (NE Germany) to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilization rates and crop straw recycling (i.e., straw incorporation) on anthropogenic desilication in the long term. Our results clearly show that crop straw recycling not only prevents anthropogenic desilication (about 43–60% of Si exports can be saved by crop straw recycling in the long term), but also replenishes plant available Si stocks of agricultural soil–plant systems. Furthermore, we found that a reduction of N fertilization rates of about 69% is possible without considerable biomass losses. This economy of the need for N fertilizers potentially can be combined with the benefits of crop straw recycling, i.e., enhancement of carbon sequestration via straw inputs and prevention of anthropogenic desilication of agricultural soil–plant systems. Thus crop straw recycling might have the potential to act as key management practice in sustainable, low fertilization agriculture in the temperate zone in the future.},

 abstract = {Agricultural management can influence soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and thus may contribute to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The soil depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOC is uncertain. Soil depth may have an important bearing on soil carbon dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to capture fully changes in SOC stocks. This applies in particular to the evaluation of carbon farming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the upper metre of mineral cropland soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify depth-specific effects on SOC stocks of common agricultural management practices: mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, a crop rotation with preceding crops (pre-crops), straw incorporation, application of farmyard manure (FYM), liming, and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction on SOC stocks were examined as a negative side effect of agricultural management. Results showed that 19 ± 3 % of total management effects on SOC stocks were found in the upper subsoil (30–50 cm) and 3 ± 4 % in the lower subsoil (50–100 cm), including all agricultural management practices with significant topsoil SOC effects, while 79 ± 7 % of management effects were in the topsoil (0–30 cm). Nitrogen and NPK fertilisation were the treatments that had the greatest effect on subsoil organic carbon (OC) stocks, followed by irrigation, FYM application and straw incorporation. Sampling down to a depth of 50 cm resulted in significantly higher SOC effects than when considering topsoil only. A crop rotation with pre-crops, liming, reduced tillage and soil compaction did not significantly affect SOC stocks at any depth increment. Since approximately 20 % of the impact of agricultural management on SOC stocks occurs in the subsoil, we recommend soil monitoring programs and carbon farming schemes extend their standard soil sampling down to 50 cm depth to capture fully agricultural management effects on SOC.},

@article{specka_reproducing_2016,
 abstract = {In undulating landscapes erosion is largely responsible for the spatial distribution of C stocks in agricultural soils. Whether these stocks contribute to global atmospheric CO2 concentrations as source or sink of CO2 is under constant debate. Periodic CO2 measurements were carried out at a hummocky ground moraine site grown with maize, fodder rye and sorghum using dynamic non-steady-state transparent and opaque chambers. Flux calculation for CO2 was conducted using the empirical gap-filling model of Hoffmann et al. (2015b), which uses temperature and radiation to simulate ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) and to calculate net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). This model was compared with a process-based agro-ecosystem simulation model, MONICA, which was tested for its ability to simulate Reco, GPP and NEE, using the empirical model as benchmark. Both models simulated GPP and Reco in the same order of magnitude, with MONICA simulating a considerably higher amount of CO2 produced by photosynthesis for maize and less deviating CO2 produced by photosynthesis for the other crops and CO2 consumed by respiration for all crops as compared to the empirical model. Both models largely agree in CO2 flux patterns, but show considerable differences directly after harvest and during bare soil periods. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches were discussed and synergies of applying both approaches in conjunction were identified in a way that (i) MONICA may act as an independent method to identify significant deviations from the optimum crop growth pattern and thus point at times during which assumptions of the empirical model for simulating NEE may be violated and that (ii) the empirical model may act as a calibration benchmark for MONICA flux simulations.},

 abstract = {Sustainable soil management requires reliable and accurate monitoring of changes in soil organic matter (SOM). However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultural experiments in Bad Lauchstädt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Müncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha−1 each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha−1 or 0.1–0.4 g C kg−1 soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amendments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330°C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520°C. Furthermore, differences between measured (with TML110–550) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML330) and clay contents (with TML140) were confirmed as a suitable indicator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermogravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.},

 abstract = {Sustainable agricultural land use requires an assessment of degradable soil organic matter (SOM) because of its key function for soil fertility and plant nutrition. Such an assessment for practical land use should consider transformation processes of SOM and its sources of different origin. In this study, we combined a 120-day incubation experiment with thermal decay dynamics of agricultural soils altered by added organic amendments. The aim was to determine the abilities and limits of thermal analysis as a rapid approach revealing differences in the degradability of SOM. The carried out experiments based on two independent sampling sets. The first sample set consisted of soil samples taken from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs), then artificially mixed with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal equal to 60 Mg ha−1 under laboratory conditions. The second sample set based on soil samples of different treatments (e.g., crop type, fertilization, cultivation) in LTAEs at Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg, Germany. Before and after the incubation experiment, thermal mass losses (TML) at selected temperatures were determined by thermogravimetry indicating the degradability of organic amendments mixed in soils. The results confirmed different microbial degradability of organic amendments and SOM under laboratory conditions. Thermal decay dynamics revealed incubation-induced changes in the artificial soil mixtures primarily at TML around 300°C in the case of applied straw and sheep faeces, whereas farmyard manure showed mainly changes in TML around 450°C. Charcoal did not show significant degradation during incubation, which was confirmed by TML. Detailed analyses of the artificial soil mixtures revealed close correlations between CO2-C evolution during incubation and changes in TML at 300°C with R2 > 0.96. Results of the soils from LTAEs showed similar incubation-induced changes in thermal decay dynamics for fresh plant residues and farmyard manure. We conclude that the practical assessment of SOM could be facilitated by thermal decay dynamics if modified sample preparation and evaluation algorithms are used beyond traditional peak analysis.},

 abstract = {Soil hydrological conditions influence crop growth and groundwater recharge and, thus, precise knowledge of such conditions at field scale is important for the investigation of agricultural systems. In our study, we analyzed soil hydrological conditions at three agricultural experimental field plots with sandy soils and different crop rotations using a 22-year period from 1993 to 2014 with daily volumetric soil water contents measured by the Time Domain Reflectometry with Intelligent MicroElements (TRIME)-method and pressure heads determined by automatic recording tensiometers. These measured data were compared with soil water contents and pressure heads simulated by a process-based agroecosystem model. Within this 22-year period, time spans with a better model performance and periods with a lower goodness of fit between simulations and observations were observed. The lower goodness of fit in the summer periods was attributed to inadequate calculations of root water uptake. Measurement errors of the TRIME-probes and differences between soil water contents measured by TRIME and pressure heads observed by tensiometers due to different measurement volumes, precision and measuring principles were identified as further reasons for mismatches between simulated and measured model outputs.},
