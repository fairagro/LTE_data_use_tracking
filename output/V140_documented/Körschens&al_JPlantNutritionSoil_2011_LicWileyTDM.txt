Turnover of Soil Organic Matter (SOM) and Long-Term Balances - Tools for Evaluating Sustainable Productivity of Soils Martin Kiirschens, Annett Weigel and Elke Schulz Centre for Environmental Research Leipzig-Halle Ltd., Department of Soil Sciences Bad Lauchstadt, Hallesche Str. 44, D-06246 Bad Lauchstadt, Germany Accepted 8 May 1998 Summary - Zusammenfassmg Using data from long-term experiments at the Loess-Chernozem site, Bad Lauchstjidt und 12 other European sites. the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils, the determination of decomposable soil organic matter (SOM), the effect on yield of SOM as well as carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Both C and N in SOM have to be divided into M inert and a decomposable fraction. The inert C is strongly correlated with clay content, while most changes in both C and N occur in the readily decomposable fraction. In the experi- ments considered the latter ranges between 0.2 to 0.696 C and 0.02 to 0.06% N. The annual changes of the C,,, content amount only to about 0.01 % Corn corresponding to 500 kg/ha. even under extreme changes of the fertilizing system. Hot water extractable C (Chre) has proved to be an appropriate crite- rion for the calculation of the decomposable C and thus for the N release from soil. Different methods to maintain a SOM balance are compared and first guideline values for an agronomically and C C O ~ O & ~ callyjustified SOM content of arable soils are recommended. In arable soils the exceeding of an upper C,,, value influences neither crop yield nor the C and N balance in a positive way. In terms of ecology and envi- ronment. set-aside-programmes or fallows in a crop rotation affect the balances negatively. Atmospheric N deposition can amount to aboul SO kglhayr.

The maintenance of soil functions increasingly requires global thinking and these functions are discussed at present from very different points of view. The diversity of soil functions with partly the same or an overlapping meaning complicates their clear definition. In this paper only the ecological and not the social, soil functions will be considered. They are subdivided in accor- dance with Blum (1997) as: - the production function (food, energy, raw materials) - the regulatory function (filter-, buffer- and transforma- tion functions) - the habitat function (including the gene reserve). In the last few years situations have emerged, which give reason for serious concern. Every year millions of human beings die of starvation and the nourishment of nearly 1 billion is insufficient. The area of arable land, however, decreases on a global scale by about 10 million ha per year. Thus the production function should definitively have priority in agricultural research (Diez, 1995). With regard to the environment the regulatory function of soils is decisive. It is linked with the production and decay of biomass and with the assimilation and emission of CO, on which the CO, cycle depends. Whereas uncropped soils (i.e. under fallow) might be a source of CO,, an optimized crop production could lead to a de- crease of CO, in the atmosphere. But the soil by its defini- tion as ‘the uppermost, inhabited part of the earth’s crust in the overlapping area of lithosphere, atmosphere and hydrosphere . . . . is the site for the plants and habitat for the reducents. . . . .’ (Autorenkollektiv, 1991). Regarding its Z. Pflanzenernahr. Bodenk., 161, 4 0 9 4 2 4 (1998) 0 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, D-69451 Weinheim, 1998 0044-3263/98/0408-0409$17.50+ .50/0 Korschens. Weigel and Schulz pedological state the soil develops inter alia also through the growth of plants and all important soil functions are influenced by the vegetation. A soil permanently free of vegetation is no longer a soil in the sense of this definition. The definition and determination of soil organic matter (SOM) is still not clear (Korschens et al., 1997). According to Muller (1980) SOM is defined as ‘the living and dead organic matter, which is integrated in soil, where the first the edaphone (autochthonous microorga- represents nisms) and the latter the humus’. A direct analytical determination of SOM is impractical, with exception of clay- and carbonate- free soils (Kuntze et al., 1988). It is common to calculate SOM by multiplying% organic carbon by the factor 1.724 (Kononova, 1958) or 2 (Blume, 1990). According to Kuntze et al. (1988), Ras- mussen and Collins (1991), Riek (1995) the conversion factor ranges between 1.4 and 3.3. Because of this uncer- tainty it is more precise to use O/o Corg determined by ana- lysis. The carbon and nitrogen cycles in the soil/plant system are also not fully elucidated and quantified. They, however, are of particular and crucial importance, because: 0 both elements are essential for soil functions, but the ranges of favourable and harmful effects are very narrow 0 both cycles depend strongly on external influences and are, therefore, difficult to control, 0 they are subject to strong site and weather dependent variability which impedes their quantification. 0 the diversity and stability of their chemical structures are insufficiently known. To solve these open questions two approaches were pur- sued in the past. On the one hand intensive humus re- search (humus chemistry) attempted to elucidate the che- mical structures of SOM by developing fractionation methods (Tjurin, 195 1; Kononova, 1958; Kogel-Knabner and Guggenberger, 1995). On the other hand empirical approaches were used to quantify the effects of SOM by evaluating field and model experiments, as well as by the simulation of different compartments of SOM. On this basis threshold values for 9’0 C were derived (Heinonen, 1974; Franko, 1997; Korschens et al., 1986). There is still a big difference between both approaches. Up to now the evaluation of field experimental data does not offer sufficient clarity in the caweleffect relations. Nevertheless useful conclusions can be derived from the results for sustainable soil management. In the following long-term experimental data are used to contribute to the solution of these pending questions. Results will be pre- sented about: 0 the dynamics of carbon and nitrogen in soil 0 the influence of SOM on crop yield the between ’Oil and adjacent water and atmospheric ecosystems 0 the C and N output on basis of balances 2 Material and methods Investigations on the topics outlined above require long-term experi- ments with a corresponding intensive data collection over many years, preferably decades because ‘organic carbon’ and ‘nitrogen’ in soil and also crop yields show a high spatial and temporal variability. Significant results can, consequently, only be achieved with an appropriate number of replications in space and time. The majority of investigations presented in this paper were done at Bad Lauchstadt where the soil is a Loess-Chernozem (Haplic Cher- nozem) with 21 % clay, 110 m above sea level, 484 mm annual precipita- tion (average 1896-1995) and 8.7OC mean annual temperature (average 1896-1995). The ‘Static Fertilization Experiment Bad Lauchstadt’, started in 1902, provides the most important data base. On one part of this field experi- ment an extension to the experiment was introduced in 1978 to discern the influence of highly different SOM contents on yield and C and N dynamics. Detailed information on this experiment and the site can be found in Korschens et al. (1994). Organic carbon was determined by dry combustion according to STROHLEIN. Nitrogen was determined according to KJELDAHL. Hot water extractable carbon (ChWe) was determined to estimate the decom- posable part of soil organic matter (Behm, 1988; Korschens et al., 1990; Schulz, 1990 and 1997). To help verify the conclusions derived from the Bad Lauchstadt exper- iment results of other long-term experiments are used (Tab. 1). 3 Results and discussion 3.1 C and N dynamics The following observations on the C and N dynamics are based on the fact, that SOM can be divided into at least 2 fractions. One is relatively ‘inert’’’ and hardly involved in C transformations, while the other is mineralizable/ decomposable (Korschens, 1980a and b). Jenkinson and Rayner (1977) identified altogether 5 SOM fractions with clearly different half life periods and subdivided the stable part into ‘physically stabilized’ and ‘chemically stabilized’ SOM. Franko (1997) differentiates in a simulation model the mineralizable part of SOM further in an ‘active’ and a ‘stabilized’ fraction. The inert C and N is, with only few exceptions, closely correlated with the clay content (Fig. 1) and for calcula- tions regarding C and N dynamics this inert C is of little importance. Changes within a foreseeable period can only be detected for the decomposable part of SOM. Tschernozem started in 1956 by Ansorge (1966). The plots already had large differences in their Yo C. During the 40 years without any fertilizer, C,,, in the treatment without fertilizer since 1902 decreased only slightly and seems to have reached at 1.5% Corg, its final value and a new equilibrium indicating the ‘inert’ Corg con- tent of this site. There were larger decreases in% C in soils I ) The term “inert” carbon is used here for that part of carbon, which remains in soil over many decades even under bare fallow and without any fertilization. 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

Similar results were found in a long-term experiment in Ultuna (Sweden, see Tab. l), where after 30 years there was a value of 1.04% Corg in the unfertilized bare fallow. In a light sandy soil at Thyrow (Germany) the Corg content of the unfertilized 'Nil' plot was 0.34% Corg after 50 years and this was compa- rable to that of a bare fallow because there was no plant growth. In the following sections the difference between the C,,, content and the inert C (CJ is, for practical reasons, consi- dered as the decomposable carbon (Cdec).

For selected long-term experiments with soils with dif- ferent clay content but with nearly the same farmyard manure (FYM) application, the ‘inert’ and decomposable carbon (cdec) is presented in Fig. 3. Ci increases with increasing clay content from 0.34% to 2.45 O/o, the Cdcc from 0.11 O/o to 0.63 Yo. This increase in both fractions is caused by the fact that Ci increases with clay content, as discussed previously, and Cdcc increases because the mineralization rate decreases. In sandy soils the absolute content of C,,, is consequent- ly lower, but as a proportion of the total carbon it is higher. From these and previous results (Korschens, et al. 1997), it is clear that the optimum Cdec content in loam and loess soils under European temperate climate conditions is below 0.6%. On sandy soils it is difficult to achieve > 0.4% Cdec which, for other reasons, would be considered too low, for example soil physical properties are closely correlated with the carbon content and could be improved by an increase of Corg in soil (Korschens and Wuldschmidt, 1995). The C,,, anc r content of soil changes very slowly. At a farm scale alterations in soil management are generally not detectable until after 10 years. To investigate the dyna- mics of Car, and N, in soil it is, therefore, advisable to col- lect and analyze soil samples taken each year from each plot to discern any trends. On one part of the ‘Static Fertilization Experiment Bad Lauchstadt’ the fertilization was reversed after 75 years of constant treatment. In part of the former FYM + N treat- ments, with soils containing 2.3 Yo Car, this treatment was stopped, whereas from 1978 the highest organic-mineral fertilization has been applied on part of the former ‘Nil’ plot. This made it possible, to quantify changes in C,,, and N, during 18 years after extreme changes in fertilizer use (Fig. 4). In 1978 the FYM + N treated soil had 2.25% C,,, and after this treatment was stopped, Yo C,,, declined by 0.013% annually, corresponding to a loss of 520 kg C/ha, and % N by 0.001 1 % N annually, amounting to 44 kg N/ha. This calculated quantity of N is in very good agreement with the difference in N uptake between the previous FYM + N plot and the continuous ‘Nil’ plot. 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

Following the application of FYM to the previously unfertilized plot the increase in Corg was 0.0081 O/o annually and for nitrogen it was 0.0012% N annually. It is obvious, that it will be many decades before a new equilibrium is reached. The rate of increase in Corg and N can also be seen in an- other long-term experiment started in 1984 on the Loess- in Bad Lauchstadt. The plots received Chernozem extremly large amounts of FYM (0, 50, 100 and 200 t/ha per year) with a crop rotation’) and a bare fallow. (Fig. 5 and 6) All FYM treated soils show a significant increase in both Corg and N in the plough layer. With 200 t/ha - yr FYM there was an increase of 1.8% Corg by 1996, which corre- sponds to an accumulation of 35% of the carbon applied with the FYM. The relatively small increase of Corg in the subsoil is not considered in the following calculation. Averaged over all treatments and years, there is about 0.28% less C and 0.027% less N in bare fallow soils than in I) sugar beet, maize, winter wheat, potato, maize, winter wheat, sugar beet, potato, maize, sugar beet, potato, maize, sugar beet those growing the crop rotation.

Another explanation could be, that as the vegetation density increases with increasing rates of FYM then there may have been less soil aeration which decreased mineralization intensity. In summary it can be concluded that in considering C, N dynamics for agronomic and ecological purposes a know- ledge of Cdec changes is more informative than those of total Corn. In the following chapter the possibilities for estimating the decomposable C by means of simple determinable chemical parameters will be discussed. 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

A simple and reliable method for an approximate deter- mination of CdeC is the hot water extraction (Schulz, 1997). As water is used as solvent this fractionation nearly corre- sponds to natural conditions (Korschens et al., 1990; Schulz, 1990) and provides realistic results. Beck (1984) and Insam and Domsch (1988) have shown that the earliest detectable effects of changes in the supply of organic matter to soils are in the most readily mineralizable frac- tion. The hot water extractable fraction is not a well defined fraction of the SOM. It contains parts of the soil microbial biomass, simple organic compounds and compounds which are hydrolyzable or depolymerizable under the given extraction conditions by water (Schulz, 1997). Thus Chwe can be considered as part of the active SOM (Franko, 1997). The close relation between the hot water extractable fraction (Ch,,) and microbial biomass is seen in the highly significant correlation between Chwe and soil respiration (? = 0.97 n = 15) and with the nitrate release during incu- bation (I = 0.91, n = 15) respectively (Schulz, 1990). The results for Chwe, cumulated respiration over a 35 day period and N mineralization for 3 European long-term experiments (analyzed as part of an EU project) showed significant correlations between Chw,/microbial biomass r = 0.92, C,,,/respiration r = 0.88 and Chw,/N mineraliza- tion r = 0.77 (Tab. 2). From the results of previous extensive investigations on potentially mineralizable carbon and nitrogen by Stanford and Smith (1972) and by Freytag (1987) with the long-term experimental data given here, the following mathematical relation could be derived: Cdcc = l5 ’ Chwe A similar factor for the conversion of Chwe to Cdcc was found by Manzke (1995). The relationship between the ‘inert’C and the content of clay and fine silt was quantified using data from a large number of long-term experiments as follows (Korschens, 1980): Cine“ = 0.04 . (Oh clay+fine silt), (particles < 6.3 pm) Thus if C,,, equals Cdec + Cine” then: C,,, = 15 . Chwe + 0.04 (Oh clay+fine silt) To validate this formula the experimental data from 2 sites Bad Lauchstadt (Haplic Chernozem) and Thyrow (Albic Luvisol) were used (Fig. 7). The scatter and the fitted lines suggest that, as a first approximation, Chwe could be used to estimate Cdec. 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

This suggests that for these soils there is a limit for SOM depletion below Chat values < 20 mg/100 g soil dry matter (Tab. 4). Differences in the proportion of Chwe in Corg are due to the different amounts of Ci in the total soil carbon. From the analysis of more than 1000 soil samples from different long-term experiments, model experiments and farms of the former GDR five groups of Chwc were pro- posed to rate the SOM content of soils using hot water extractable carbon as a parameter (Tab. 5): 3.3 The effects of SOM on yield SOM is important for sustaining the production func- tion of a soil. SOM effects can come from (1) nutrients and (2) improvements in soil structure including physical properties, like water holding capacity, bulk density and sorption capacity. Improvements in yield due to SOM have been demon- strated (Asmus, 1995; Korschens et al., 1997), but the 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

In these investigations, however, the nutrient effect could not be separated from the soil quality improving effect. Some effects of different SOM levels in combination with farmyard manure and dif- ferent mineral N levels on yields are now available from the extension to the Static Fertilization Experiment Bad Lauchstadt (Fig. 8). In average of all crops and years for the Loess-Cher- nozem site no positive yield response neither by a higher SOM level in soil nor by FYM application was found when mineral fertilization was at optimum. Relative yields varied between 97 and 1010/0. As far as nutrient effects of SOM are concerned the application of mineral N fertilizer increased yields at all levels of SOM (Fig. 9). In the treatments without FYM, on average, 43 kg/ha. yr more mineral N fertilizer was necessary to reach the highest yield but optimal N declined from 147 kg N/ha at low SOM (1.69O/oC0,,) to 108 kgN/aathighest SOM.IntheFYMplots optimal mineral N ranged from 96 at low SOM to 67 kg N/ha at 2.22% C,,,. This result supports the conclusion that on this site the soil improving effect ofSOM on crop yield (Fig. 8) was less important than the nitrogen effect of decompo- sable SOM.Thus the decomposable SOM and its N release as well as the N supply by FYM and by mineral fertilizer are decisive for growth and yield. For the evaluation of sustainability of various land use systems nutrient balances and organic matter fluxes are an indispensable tool. Nitrogen balances are of special impor- tance, because the effects on yield and the risk of pollu- tion are closely related. Improper, excessive use of nitrogen has led in recent decades to high N losses. Carbon balances, on the one hand, are of growing interest for the estimation of the sink potential of soils for atmos- pheric C02, and the role of agricultural systems in the global carbon cycle. Long-term experiments allow a relatively simple calcula- tion of balances by comparing the input in form of fertilizer with the output in form of harvested products. Further bal- ance factors, like C and N input via seeds and indirect C inputs (fuel C consumed in the manufacturing of pesticides, fertilizer, fuel) can be neglected as constant factors. In almost all of the long-term experiments reported here (Tab. 1) the C and N contents in soil have reached an equi- librium. For experiments of shorter duration and with extreme fertilization treatments the changes are well docu- mented by measurements during many years and can thus be quantified and used for balances. 3.4.1 Nitrogen balances Tab. 6 presents the nitrogen balances for 8 long-term experiments at 6 sites.

Balance =Output (N uptake by plants + increasing soil N) minus Input (Fertilizer + atmospheric N deposition + de- creasing soil N) The changes in N content of soil were quantified via linear regressions of measured values during the evalua- tion period. The N inputs from unknown sources but probably atmospheric deposition were incorporated in the calcula- tion based on the N removal by the crops harvested on each unfertilized plot during the respective period. At the different sites values range from 17 to 123 kg N/ha. In the two Bad Lauchstadt experiments 50-58 kg N/hayr were calculated as the average of 32 and 19 experimental years respectively. The amount was confirmed by direct measu- rements of the N deposition into a soil/plant system by Mehlerf (1996). Data from the model experiment with extremely high FYM applications where 123 kg N/ha uptake were measured for the unfertilized plot are ex- cluded. The N uptake of 61 kglhayr from the unfertilized plot of the Czech experiment corresponds quite well with the value at Bad Lauchstadt (Tab. 6). At all other sites N uptakes in the nil plots were lower (17-43 kglhayr). On the sandy soils at Skierniewice (Poland) and Thyrow (Germany) a part of the N deposi- tion was probably lost by leaching, in the Broadbalk experi- ment (Rothamsted, Great Britain) and in the Permanent Rye Experiment (Halle, Germany) the low N uptakes from the unfertilized plots (34 and 25 kg N/ha.yr respectively) are possibly related to the fact that the crops were grown in monoculture. This is supported for Broadbalk by the great N uptake by the grown crop in rotation and by direct deposition measurements at Rothamsted which amount to more than 50 kg/hayr (Goulding, 1990). A comparison of the sites with regard to nitrogen losses (as expressed by negative N balances), shows the lowest N Korschens. Weigel and Schulz losses for the Loess-Chernozem at Bad Lauchstadt, ex- cluding the model experiment with its very large FYM applications. A rooting depth down to 2 m and low annual precipitation favour a high N efficiency at this site. The lowest N utilization or in other words the greatest loss of input N was recorded in the sandy soil in Thyrow, followed by the treatment with FYM at Rothamsted, where for more than 150 years with 35 t FYM/hayr annually enor- mous N quantities have been applied and where the mari- time climate with 725 mm rainfall per year favours N leaching. Conclusions with regard to the influence of different C levels in soil and different fertilizers on the N and C bal- ance can be drawn from the extension part of the ‘Static Fertilization Experiment Bad Lauchstadt’. The plots at the start point of this experiment (Fig. 10) had either 1.7 or 2.3% Corg respectively as a result of 75 years of different fertilization, i.e. without fertilizer orwith 15 t FYM/hayr+NPK. Comparing the N balances at both C levels the losses increase with increasing fertilization more rapidly on the C rich soils. The optimum rate of N fertilizer is distinctly lower due to the greater N release from the soil (see also section 3.3). Accordingly higher losses are to expected, because the N release from the soil cannot be controlled. The comparison of different forms of fertilization is of special interest (Tab. 6). Contrary to the common opinion of advocates of organic farming, mineral fertilization has resulted in the lowest N losses. Results on other sites con- firm, that this is not only due to the favourable conditions of the Loess-Chernozem in Bad Lauchstadt. At the sandy sites in Thyrow and Skierniewice small losses (22-29 kg) and a high N utilization (64-71 O/o) were also reported for those treatments which had received mineral fertilizer only. Higher losses of 25-77 kg at usual farm levels of FYM application and of 127-167 kg N where 35 t FYM/ hayr were applied were measured for the exclusively organic fertilization. Thus the N utilization was 25-74%. The model experiment with large FYM applications gave some specific results. Treatments with 100 and 200 t FYM/hayr do not correspond with the conditions in prac- tical farming, but provide valuable information for the potential accumulation of C and N in soil. At the highest FYM level 48% of the FYM N got lost and 40% had been stored in the soil, on average, during 13 years. Results of older long-term experiments show that with increasing experimental duration the annual increase of N in soil becomes smaller as SOM increases towards a new equi- librium value. This, however, also means that in the future an increase of the N losses is to be expected. 3.4.2 Carbon balance Carbon balances are of growing interest for the estima- tion of the sourcelsink potential of soils for atmospheric CO,. However, the sink potential of arable soils is very low. 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

Weigel and Schulz On the basis of the data from the long-term experiments discussed here there is only a very narrow range of decom- posable carbon in arable soils, namely 0.2 to 0.6%. Lower values lead to a lower fertility and thus productivity. The application of large amounts of organic matter increases the microbial transformation processes, which leads to a high CO, and nutrient release. The latter is supported by the results of the N balances, where it was obvious that the risk of N losses increased with increasing supply of organic manure. So to have any positive influence on the global CO, balance arable soils should be used to produce biomass as a source for obtaining energy and raw mate- rials. The C balances of the long-term experiments included in Tab. 7 are calculated as follows: C balance = C output (harvested plant + increase soil C) minus C input (fertilizer - decrease soil C) 0 harvested plant C = dry matter yield . factor 0.4 0 FYM C = applied amount . factor 0.1' 0 1 kg mineral N = 1.5 kg C (Vernon Cole et al., 1993) The C input in form of mineral P and K per ha was ac- cording to the fuel requirement/kg P or K fertilizer given by Van Dasselar and Pothoven (1994) irrelevant for the C balance and therefore neglectable. Other balance factors, as seeds, plant protection pro- ducts', etc. are constant factors in these fertilization expe- riments and can be disregarded like the C input for P and K. A comparison of the C balances for the different fertiliza- tion treatments shows for all sites a positive balance for the exclusively mineral fertilizer treatments. Negative bal- ances, i.e. C losses, were calculated for the highest FYM treatment in the model experiment Bad Lauchstiidt, for the 35 t/ha. yr FYM treatment where crops were grown in rotation on Broadbalk at Rothamsted and for the FYM treatment in Thyrow. The additional use of mineral N in the combined organic-mineral treatments improved the C balances compared to the organic fertilization alone. Results from the extension part of the Static Fertiliza- tion Experiment show that a higher C level in soil has no modifying effect on the C balance (Tab. 7, Fig. 10). The C balance for both plots, 1.7 and 2.3% Corg respectively are similar. But the results for the N balances have shown, that a higher C level represents a higher potential for N losses and is altogether more difficult to control. 3.5 Calculation of the humus demand In agricultural advisory work the humus balance is a tool to calculate the necessary supplementation of organic matter. Different approaches can be followed. ' for Bad Lauchstadt the analyzed C values of the FYM were available: 1 fresh matter t FYM = 0.0875 t C the C expenditure for seeds, plant protection, fuel etc. was calculated for the experiments in Bad Lauchstadt to be equivalent to 0.2 t / h a . yr (Van Dasselar and Pothoven, 1994) Welte (1963) presupposed a knowledge about the humus content of soil and calculates the essential annual supply by means of the equation: A = k, (H, + A) where H, = humus content under equilibrium conditions, A = annual input of organic matter (organic fertilizers, crop and root residues) and k, = is a decay coefficient. Kortleven (1963) assumed the humus content to corre- spond to approximately twenty times the annual input and calculates humus substitution using the equation y, = K, / K, . x is humus content in steady state, which is rea- where y, ched after many years constant fertilization, K, is the humification coefficient, K, the decay coeficient and x the input of organic matter. Rauhe (1965) took on the one hand N in the soil and on the other hand N in the primary organic matter (POM) as the reference value for the calculation of the amount of organic materials needed to maintain the humus balance. He estimated that for the compensation of the annual SOM loss, 20 times as much organic material as the annual N uptake by the crops is required. This then depends on the species and yield. For example: One hectar cereals with a yield of 3.5 t/ha decomposes 1 t/ha humus, corresponding to 1 humus unit (HU) with 50 kg N. For compensation 10 t FYM are necessary. The humus balance methods as used above were applied for more than 30 years in Germany. During this time con- ditions have changed considerably, the application of N fertilizer has about doubled just as the yields have done. Also fertilizer management has become more sophisticat- ed and plant protection as well as husbandry techniques have improved. Under the present conditions therefore the calculation of a humus balance must now start from the following premises: w The quantity of crop and root residues remaining in the field has increased in the last decades, thus there is a better supply of organic matter to the soils. w A SOM balance must be based on C, not N, as N can be applied at any time, for example together with the incorpo- ration of straw or with other organic fertilizers of wide C/N ratio. w Only the decomposable part of SOM should be consi- dered. The guideline value corresponds to 0.2-0.6% C,,, (see section 3.6). A sandy soil with only 3 O/o clay and 0.7% Cor, is well supplied with SOM, while a Loess-Chernozem with 21% clay only reaches the same level of Cdcc at ap- proximately 2% Corg. In both cases the decomposable C amounts 0.4 to 0.5 %. The yield effectiveness of the SOM only amounts up to 10%. With exclusive mineral fertilization at least 90% of the potential yield can be achieved and this on a most effi- cient and ecological basis. For arable soils there is an upper limit to SOM on ecolo- gical consideration if exceeding the limit has no positive 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

A simple method for the calculation of the demand for ‘replacement effective organic matter’ (ROM) by different soil types or cropping systems was suggested by Autoren- kollektiv (1977). On the basis of numerous long-term expe- riments so-called ‘coverage’ factors for meeting the ROM requirement were derived. They demonstrate the diffe- rence between crops drawing on and accumulating humus respectively (Tab. 8). As a standard the dry matter of FYM was used, 1 t FYM dry matter corresponds to 1 t ROM. To meet the SOM demand by different organic fertilizers ‘coverage’ factors were calculated to be equivalent to 1 t FYM dry matter (Tab. 9). These factors account for the different substitu- tion effectiveness of the various organic fertilizers. For example: After sugar beet on Chernozem 2.9 t ROM/ha are necessary to meet the losses of SOM in the soil (Tab. 8, line 1, column 4). 2.9 t ROM are equal to 2.9 t FYM dry matter or 14.5 t FYM fresh matter (Tab. 11, line 1) or 4.35 t straw (Tab. 9, line 4). This method of calculating ROM requirement is used in several provinces of Germany and is the most appropriate method because it was derived following extensive investi- gations to quantify and verify the factors. However, the method does not consider differences in Corg content ofsoils, but assumes that there is alreadya sufficient level of SOM. Leithold et al. (1996) modified the factors of the ‘simple method for calculation of demand for organic matter’, given in Tab. 8 and 9, and combined these data with the HU according to Ruuhe and Schonmeier (1966). The demand of ROM using this modified method is a little more than 100% higher than that of the simple method. However, site differences are no longer considered. Unfor- tunately there is not sufficient experimental proof for the increased coverage factors. For ‘organic farming’ the ROM demand is assumed by Leithold et al. (1996) to be 50% higher to compensate for the nutrients which cannot be applied in mineral ferti- lizers. Another simple humus balance method has been pro- posed by Diez and Krauss (1992). They balance the yearly humus loss due to mineralization against the C input by crop and root residues and organic fertilizers taking into consideration different humus reproduction coefficients. Tab. 10 presents the results by different balance methods for three contrasting sites and compares them with the experimentally determined optimum. The results show a good agreement between optimum values and the first method. The method of Diez and Kruuss (1992) shows quite a good agreement, except that the lower the total SOM content the greater the discrepancy between the cal- culated demand and the optimum. This is due to the fact that in this method the decay is related to the total SOM content. Consequently the demand increases as the clay content increases and thus with the ‘inert’ C content. This means that on the sandy soil at Thyrow the calculated demand is the lowest. The estimated demand for organic manures using method I11 is in all cases much higher than the experimen- tally determined optimum, in some cases nearly 100% higher. For organic farming, as mentioned above, even 30 t EYMIha each year would be required to balance the humus.This amount of FYM would apply 180 kg N/ha.yr, and some mineralization will occur in periods, when there is no N uptake by plants, inevitably leading to high lea- ching and gaseous N losses. The situation would not be much better if organic fertilizers other than FYM, i.e. straw, were used because for humus formation nitrogen is necessary. This N may be supplied as legume N or as atmospheric deposition, or as inorganic N residues in soil. This immobilized N will later be released again during the decomposition of SOM. Accordingly a large humus supply can make the N release from a soil unpredictable and leads, therefore, to larger N losses (Diez, 1995). 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

As Tab. 11 shows these values increase from l-1.SOh SOM (Gorp X 1.724)” in sandy soils to 3.5-4.4Yo SOM in clay soils, the increase being due to the proportion of Ci increasing with clay content. The ranges for the optimum SOM content are relatively small when the lower value of the range is set as equiva- lent to 0.5% of decomposable SOM (For example: for a soil with 4% clay + fine silt, (first line in Tab. ll), 0.5% is inert SOM, this plus 0.5% decomposable SOM gives 1% total SOM. The difference between lower and upper limit of the recommended ranges amounts to well 0.5 Yo decompo- sable SOM, so that with 1 Oh the highest recommendable supply is reached, which corresponds to 35 to 45 tlha decomposable SOM in the plough layer.

Discussions about SOM require that at least two frac- tions are considered, one being relatively inert (hardly involved in mineralization processes), the other being decomposable and thus dependent on soil and crop mana- gement. Despite our recommendations to calculate only on the basis of Corg (see section 1) in practice it is still common to use SOM. 2. Changes of the Corg content in soil are almost exclusi- vely the decomposable part of the carbon which changes very slowly. 3. The soil improving effect of SOM contributes to crop yield on sandy soils up to lo%, on loamy soils up to 5%. This could be shown by comparing treatments with exclu- sively mineral fertilization with those of optimal organic+ mineral fertilization. 4. The ranges for the optimal quantities of C and N in soil are only small. At comparable sites in Germany they are between 0.2 and 0.6% Cdcc and 0.02 and 0.06% N respecti- vely. Below these values soil fertility, yield and CO, absorp- 15222624d, 1998, 4, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.1998.3581610409 by Leibniz Institut Für Agrarlandschaftsforschung (Zalf) e., Wiley Online Library on [24/07/2025].

The hot water extractable carbon has proved to be an appropriate criterion for the characterization of the decomposable carbon. 6. Raising the C level above the upper recommended limit influences neither C nor N balances in a positive way on arable soils. The potentizl of soil as a sink for carbon is only small and could result in large losses of N and C. Organic manure should only be applied in relation to the C balance on a farm and will be site specific. The optimum C content should not be exceeded. Surplus organic mate- rials would be better used as substitutes for fossil energy. 7. The results of the Broadbalk Experiment at Rotham- sted show, that on soils highly supplied with SOM a bare fallow in the crop rotation (no plant production and thus no nitrogen uptake from the soil), will distinctly aggravate N leaching and is therefore not recommendable. Crop pro- duction for food or for energy and raw material is, in ecolo- gical terms, to be preferred to set-aside-programmes. 8. The deposition of atmospheric N is an important factor in the N balance and in the calculation of optimum amount of N to be applied either as mineral or organic fer- tilizer. Its exact quantification via direct measurements and its consideration in fertilizer strategies is important. Indirect evidence from N uptake in unfertilized plots of long-term experiments indicates an atmospheric input, which can amount to about 50 kg N/hayr. References Ansorge, H.
