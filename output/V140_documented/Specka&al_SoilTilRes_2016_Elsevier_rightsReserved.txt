Whether these stocks contribute to global atmospheric CO2 concentrations as source or sink of CO2 is under constant debate. Periodic CO2 measurements were carried out at a hummocky ground moraine site grown with maize, fodder rye and sorghum using dynamic non-steady-state transparent and opaque chambers. Flux calculation for CO2 was conducted using the empirical gap-ﬁlling model of Hoffmann et al. (2015b), which uses temperature and radiation to simulate ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) and to calculate net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). This model was compared with a process-based agro-ecosystem simulation model, MONICA, which was tested for its ability to simulate Reco, GPP and NEE, using the empirical model as benchmark. Both models simulated GPP and Reco in the same order of magnitude, with MONICA simulating a considerably higher amount of CO2 produced by photosynthesis for maize and less deviating CO2 produced by photosynthesis for the other crops and CO2 consumed by respiration for all crops as compared to the empirical model. Both models largely agree in CO2 ﬂux patterns, but show considerable differences directly after harvest and during bare soil periods. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches were discussed and synergies of applying both approaches in conjunction were identiﬁed in a way that (i) MONICA may act as an independent method to identify signiﬁcant deviations from the optimum crop growth pattern and thus point at times during which assumptions of the empirical model for simulating NEE may be violated and that (ii) the empirical model may act as a calibration benchmark for MONICA ﬂux simulations. ã 2015 Elsevier B.V.

These landscapes mostly most exhibit very heterogeneous soil properties, especially with regard to soil carbon (C) stocks (Doetterl et al., 2012; van Oost et al., 2007, 2012; Vandenbygaart et al., 2012). The consequences of the spatial ﬂuxes between ecosystem compart- distribution of C stocks for C ments and CO2 exchange with the atmosphere are mainly unknown. For this reason, the contribution of agricultural land * Corresponding author. Tel.: +49 33432 82355; fax: +49 33432 82334. E-mail address: nendel@zalf.de (C.

Changes in C stocks of agricultural soils occur as a result of alterations to the balance between C input and loss. In a soil–plant system, C input is considered when CO2 is captured from the atmosphere by plants via photosynthesis and stored in their living tissue. C is lost from the system through autotrophic respiration (Ra) of the plants and through microbial decomposition of plant tissue, when soil organic carbon (SOC) is respired again to CO2 (heterotrophic respiration Rh). This happens in a slow, continuous process, but land use change may also trigger large peaks (Wei et al., 2014). Within the system, C is transferred from the plant to the soil by deposition of plant residues on the soil's surface or in X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 the soil column as dead roots (Jones et al., 2009). Root exudates add additional C to the soil during active plant growth. In sloped landscapes, erosion and deposition may signiﬁcantly alter this balance (Sanderman and Chappell, 2013; van Oost et al., 2007). However, it remains unclear at which point of the erosion– deposition process chain C sequestration or C liberation processes dominate (Berhe et al., 2007; Berhe and Kleber, 2013; Kirkels et al., 2014; Lal and Pimentel, 2008; Vandenbygaart et al., 2015). C ﬂuxes in and out of a soil–plant system are observed by means of concentration differences in the surrounding air (Smith et al., 2010). CO2 concentration measurements require a skilled set-up which does not signiﬁcantly alter the environmental conditions or else interferes with the processes that are subject of subsequent interpretation. Closed chambers are widely used to introduce an artiﬁcial system boundary for CO2 exchange with the wider atmosphere (Livingston and Hutchinson, 1995). However, closed chambers also inhibit heat and moisture exchange which causes the environmental conditions in the trapped air volume to change quickly, with signiﬁcant consequences for the plant’s physiological behaviour (Lai et al., 2012; Langensiepen et al., 2012; Pumpanen et al., 2004). For this reason, continuous CO2 concentration monitoring is extremely difﬁcult and campaign-based, discontin- uous data acquired by means of short-term chamber measure- ﬁlling methods are then ments prevail for ﬂux series from single event data. required to derive continuous Such methods are often based on simple empirical models, which simulate CO2 ﬂuxes based on temperature and radiation dynamics (Elsgaard et al., 2012; Falge et al., 2001; Hoffmann et al., 2015b; Richardson et al., 2006). These empirical models deliver not much more than a gap-free time series of what was measured and may fail in reproducing intensity and dynamics of ecosystem CO2 ﬂuxes, ﬂux analysis. Gap consequently misinterpreting the system’s contribution to the atmospheric C budget, if plant physiological development is not well captured by adequately spaced measurement campaigns. As an alternative, computer simulation models are available, which were constructed on the basis of biophysical processes and have been used already for decades to assess the impact of environmental conditions on plant growth as well as on water and nutrient dynamics in soil–plant–atmosphere systems (Ewert et al., 2015; Martre et al., 2015). Some of these models even allow for a deconstruction of the ecosystem C balance into its components (Abdalla et al., 2014; Abrahamsen and Hansen, 2000; Huang et al., 2009). However, these models have rarely been designed or tested at the level of the above-mentioned CO2 ﬂuxes, being rather used to predict environmental or management impact on more integrating variables, such as plant biomass production, yield formation or net C stocks of soils (Jandl et al., 2014; Neill, 2011; Schmid et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2012). We compared the empirical gap-ﬁlling algorithm of Hoffmann et al. (2015b, later referred to as the empirical model) with MONICA, an established process-based agro-ecosystem simulation ﬁeld-measured CO2 exchange model (Nendel et al., 2011), using ﬁeld experiment investigating the C budget of maize, data from a fodder rye and sorghum grown on different erosion-induced transient soils landscape of North-eastern Germany. Prior to this performance test we calibrated (i) MONICA’s soil part against long-term soil C dynamics in various crop rotation experiments and (ii) MONICA’s crop part against the aboveground ﬁeld experiment. From the biomass data obtained from the conceptual point of view, MONICA should be able to reﬂect the inﬂuence of site properties and weather on actual CO2 ﬂuxes and crop growth and successfully predict cumulative CO2 ﬂuxes, CO2 in the undulating X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 budgets and biomass yields at two different landscape positions: hill slope and syncline. In this exercise, we show how MONICA reproduces net ecosystem exchange (NEE) as gross primary production (GPP)–Ra–Rh of the maize–fodder rye–sorghum rota- tion. The aim of this exercise is (i) to investigate the strengths and weaknesses of both approaches and (ii) to identify promising synergies of applying both approaches is hypothesised that MONICA may act as an independent method to identify considerable changes in the crop growth pattern and thus point at times during which assumptions of the empirical model for simulating NEE may be violated. Vice versa, the empirical model may act as a calibration benchmark for MONICA ﬂux simulations. in conjunction. It 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Site description The experimental ﬁeld site is located in the Uckermark, NE Germany, a hummocky ground moraine landscape (Fig. 1; 53(cid:1)23N, 13(cid:1)47E, 50–60 m asl). Between 1992 and 2012, an average annual rainfall of 485 mm and a mean annual air temperature of 8.6 (cid:1)C were recorded by the ZALF Experimental Field Station in Dedelow (www.zalf.de). Climatic conditions are characterised by large inter- annual variability of precipitation, whereas no temporal trend can be detected in decadal rainfall or temperature. in ﬂow the upper 2 m cover The study area shows a complex soil pattern mainly inﬂuenced by relief and type of parent material, e.g. sandy to marly glacial and glacio-ﬂuvial deposits. Along a natural catena, Haplic or Stagnic Luvisols show at knolls and slopes and Mollic Gleysols and Eutric Histosols at footslopes and depressions (soil classiﬁcation accord- ing to the World Reference Base, FAO, 2014). Centennial human activities, especially land use and amelioration, led to a signiﬁcant change in soil and site conditions, mainly by water and tillage erosion. Consequently, eroded soils, such as Calcaric Regosols and Calcic Luvisols, developed at hilltops and upper to mid-slope positions. Colluvic Regosols inﬂuenced either by groundwater or return footslopes and small depressions (kettle holes). Soils affected by erosion meanwhile cover 80% of the arable land, soils which are unaffected by erosion only 20% (Deumlich et al., 2010; Sommer et al., 2008). The CarboZALF-D experimental site was selected for being representa- tive for the regional ground moraine landscape. Plots include non- eroded (Albic Cutanic Luvisol), moderately (Calcic Cutanic Luvisol) to strongly eroded soils (Calcaric Regosol) as well as groundwater- inﬂuenced, colluviated soils (Endogleyic Colluvic Regosol). A crop rotation of silage maize (Zea mays L.)–winter fodder rye (Secale cereale L.)–sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) was grown from 2010 to 2012. The same amounts of mineral fertiliser were applied to all plots: 160 kg N ha(cid:3)1 in the form of calcium ammonium nitrate (74% NH4NO3 and 26% CaCO3). In this paper, we present results from the slope position (moderately eroded, plot 11) and the depression (colluviated, plot 10) for 2010 and 2011. 2.2. Field measurements 2.2.1. Environmental controls Half-hourly values of air temperature (20 cm height), soil temperatures (2, 5 and 10 cm depth), photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and precipitation were continuously recorded by a climate station installed at the site. Additionally, plot-speciﬁc air and soil temperatures were manually measured simultaneously with CO2 ﬂux measurements. Plot-speciﬁc half-hourly air and soil temperature models were derived from correlations between the respective climate station temperature records and plot-speciﬁc manual temperature data. 2.2.2. CO2 ﬂux measurements (cid:4) Periodic CO2 measurements were carried out at three permanently installed soil collars (0.75 0.75 m) at each plot ﬂow-through non-steady-state transparent (NEE; using dynamic light transmission of 86%) and opaque (ecosystem respiration— Reco) chambers (Anthony et al., 1995; Drösler, 2005) attached to an infrared gas analyser (Li-820, Lincoln, NE, USA). Full-day CO2 measurement campaigns with repeated (30–50) individual cham- time 3–5 min) were conducted ber measurements regularly every 4–6 weeks from 05/2010 to 05/2012, for a total of 18 and 21 full campaigns per plot 10 and 11, respectively. Further details on CO2 measurement methodology are given in Hoffmann et al. (2015b). (closure 2.3.

Flux calculation, ﬁlling separation into Reco,GPP, and NEE as well as subsequent gap between measurement campaigns was conducted using the R <30 s were script of Hoffmann et al. (2015b). Measurements rejected and measurements >1 min were shortened by a death band of 10% at the beginning and end, respectively (Kutzbach et al., ﬂux rate was selected from 2007). For each measurement, the ﬂux rates generated by a moving window approach all potential using a stepwise algorithm, numerous quality criteria and the Akaike information criterion (AIC; for details see Hoffmann et al., ﬁlling between measurement campaigns was 2015b). For Reco, gap campaign-speciﬁc performed using temperature-dependent ﬂuxes Arrhenius-type models by Lloyd and Taylor (1994). GPP were calculated by subtracting modelled Reco ﬂuxes from ﬂuxes, and then modelled using campaign-speciﬁc measured NEE hyperbolic PAR-dependent models (Elsgaard et al., 2012; Michaelis ﬂux rates and Menten, 1913; Wang et al., 2013). Average measured ﬁt was achieved for campaign-speciﬁc were used if no signiﬁcant Reco or GPP models. Half-hourly NEE values were calculated from ﬂuxes (Drösler, 2005; Hoffmann et al., modelled Reco and GPP 2015b), and cumulated from May 1st to April 30th of the following ﬂux from the atmosphere to year. Negative values represent a C gas ﬂux from the ecosystem to the the ecosystem; positive values a atmosphere. The uncertainty of the annual CO2 exchange was quantiﬁed using a comprehensive error prediction algorithm described in detail by Hoffmann et al. (2015b). 2.4. CO2 ﬂux simulation: the process-based modelling approach 2.4.1. Model description The MONICA model (Nendel et al., 2011) is a complete mechanistic agro-ecosystem simulation model, which was designed to simulate crop growth as well as water and nitrogen dynamics in crop and soil for applied purposes. The carbon algorithms allow for simulations of the effects of climate and management on long-term organic matter dynamics in soil and, in turn, feedback signals to soil physical properties and conditions for crop production. Crop growth description follows a generic approach, based on the SUCROS model (van Keulen et al., 1982). Daily net dry matter production by photosynthesis and respiration is driven by global radiation and temperature. [CO2] affects the crop’s maximum photosynthesis rate (Mitchell et al., 1995) and stomatal resistance (Yu et al., 2001), which in turn inﬂuences transpiration. Mainte- nance respiration Rm is calculated separately for day and night periods. It is satisﬁed with priority from assimilates provided by photosynthesis. Thereafter, growth respiration Rg limits the X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 biomass growth increment. Maintenance and growth respiration are summarised in the daily output of the model as Ra, conceptually including dark respiration Rd = Rm in the absence of light and photorespiration Rp = Rm + Rg. Assimilates are assigned to the different organ compartments according to a partitioning matrix, dependent on the crop development stage. Crop development, in turn, is calculated from a thermal sum (degree-days) and modiﬁed, when appropriate, for each stage by day length and vernalisation (Kersebaum, 1995). Crop growth is limited by water and N stress. Water stress indicated by the ratio of actual-to-potential transpiration and a crop-speciﬁc threshold value which deﬁnes the crop's sensitivity to drought. Water and nitrogen (N) uptake is calculated from the potential evaporation and crop N status, depending on the simulated root distribution, as well as the availability of water and N in different soil layers (Kersebaum, 1995). The concept of critical N concentration in plants as a function of crop biomass (Greenwood et al., 1990) is applied to assess the impact of N shortage. is The calculation of organic matter turn-over in soil is based on the routines used in the DAISY model (Hansen et al., 1991). Soil C dynamics are described by three pairs (slow or rapid decomposi- tion) of conceptual pools (soil organic matter, soil microbial biomass and added organic matter). Decomposition rate coef- ﬁcients are both temperature- and moisture-dependent, and reﬂect the environmental conditions of the simulated site; decay and respiration rates of soil microbial biomass are further inﬂuenced by soil clay content. Efﬁciency parameters determine the loss of CO2 during microbial turnover processes, which is summarised in the daily output as heterotrophic respiration Rh. 2.4.2. Model calibration: soil parameters MONICA (Nendel et al., 2011) contains the largely unaltered soil organic matter turn-over routine of the DAISY model (Hansen et al., 1991). DAISY has been previously tested against a range of long- term experiments, demonstrating its overall ability to reproduce long-term soil organic matter dynamics across different soils and climates (Smith et al., 1997). In order to calibrate MONICA to the ﬁeld experiment, the model was additionally conditions of the tested against a long-term crop rotation experiment in Münche- berg (Ellerbrock et al., 1999), which is located 95 km south of the site of the gas exchange experiment, in the same agro-environ- mental zone. The selected crop experiment was an unfertilised rotation of winter wheat, silage maize, winter rye, linseed, potato, spring barley and pea on a sandy soil, for which top soil organic carbon (SOC) measurements were available every second year. A global inverse calibration procedure was carried out, using the Nash-Sutcliffe Modelling Efﬁciency (EF, Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) and the mean absolute error (MAE, Willmott and Matsuura, 2005) as a performance indicator. The following test against the short- term CO2 gas exchange was executed on the basis of this calibration. 2.4.3. Model calibration: crop parameters MONICA has been calibrated to predict the growth of maize, also under elevated [CO2], and intensively tested for its ability to predict yields in uncalibrated situations in Germany (Nendel et al., 2011) and across four sites in different agro-environmental zones (Bassu et al., 2014). In this case, a minor calibration was carried out to better match above-ground biomass for the maize grown under sufﬁcient water supply in the terrain depression, including thermal time to emergence since the maize in the experiment emerged erratically due to remaining pre-crop maize stubbles impeding seed contact with the soil and thus proper moisture supply to the seed. For rye, MONICA has been calibrated and tested against data from Germany only (Nendel et al., 2011). No further calibration was pursued. Sorghum has been parameterised using data from a German cross-site experiment for energy cropping systems (Glemnitz et al., 2015) and additionally adjusted for above-ground biomass simulation using data from the current experiment. 2.4.4. Model set-up Information used as input for the simulation included daily weather (radiation, minimum and maximum air temperature, precipitation, relative air humidity, wind speed), soil character- istics (texture, SOC, horizon boundaries) and annual minimum and maximum depth of the groundwater table. 2.5. Comparing the models Both approaches were compared relative to each other, using standard performance indicators. The mean bias error (MBE, Addiscott and Whitmore, 1987) summarises the average error of model predictions and should tend to zero. The MBE neither measures the magnitude of errors nor the correspondence between observations and predictions, but it identiﬁes over- or under-predictions by the model. In contrast, the mean absolute error (MAE, Shaeffer, 1980) measures the average magnitude of prediction errors, but does not indicate the direction of deviations. MAE can be normalised by dividing by the observations, yielding the normalised mean absolute error the mean of at the experiment (unfertilised treatment). Lines: simulated soil organic carbon concentrations using MONICA. ‘Müncheberg V140’ X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 (nMAE). Finally, the root mean square error (RMSE) is calculated to allow the data to be compared with earlier modelling exercises in which RMSE was frequently used. RMSE is very sensitive to outliers and is also dependent on the size of the data set, which is why it has lost its popularity. The modelling efﬁciency ME (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970) is a common indicator based on the correlation between the observed and predicted values, ranging from to 1. Optimum ME equals 1 and a value of zero indicates that the model is no better estimator than the observed mean. –1 3. Results 3.1. Calibrating the process-based model against a long-term soil organic carbon experiment ‘Müncheberg V140’ In a global inverse calibration procedure using the experimental data of the long-term crop rotation experi- ment, adjusting the decomposition rate of the slowly decomposing 10(cid:3)5 (Bruun et al., 2003) to (cid:4) soil organic carbon pool from 4.3 10(cid:3)5 delivered the best simulation performance (Fig. 2). EF 3.3 for this simulation was 0.55 and the MAE was 0.30 g C kg(cid:3)1, corresponding to a normalised MAE of 6.4%. (cid:4) 3.2. Calibrating the process-based model against carboZALF above- ground biomass data Above-ground biomass was simulated by MONICA as a precondition for proving its ability to produce reasonable CO2 gas exchange rates, since plant CO2 exchange is closely related to plant biomass development. Only slightly adjusted, MONICA simulates above-ground biomass of all three crops grown in the terrain depression, where water supply has always been sufﬁcient for growth, with only minor deviations (Fig. 3, top). MONICA has not been calibrated further to match growth at the slope position where groundwater table is deeper and water not fully supplied to the crop during short periods. Here, we observe an overestimation of maize and rye growth, and a slight underestimation of sorghum growth (Fig. 3, bottom). Overall MAE was 0.81 t dry matter ha(cid:3)1 in the depression (nMAE 6.0%) and 2.05 t ha(cid:3)1 on the slope (nMAE 21.0%). 3.3. Simulation of the carboZALF gas exchange data The simulations of both model approaches (empirical and process-based) are compared against each other, assuming that at ﬁeld measurement campaigns the empirical model the dates of the – – directly relying on 30–50 individual chamber measurements represents a true measured value of daily CO2 exchange (Figs. 4 and 5). Both models simulate GPP and Reco in the same order of magnitude, with MONICA showing a more than acceptable performance in terms of the correlation-based indicator EF, but a less convincing performance with respect to the difference-based indicators MAE and MBE (Table 1). MONICA simulated a considerably higher amount of CO2 produced by photosynthesis of maize (+32% in the depression and +42% at the slope), while for fodder rye (+19% and +24%) and sorghum (–5% and –4%) the deviation was much less (Table 2). The simulation of CO2 consumed by respiration was in general less deviating from results of the –20% empirical model for all crops (maize: 0% and +5%, fodder rye: –15%, Table 2). However, the values and add up in a way that NEE simulation accumulates to more than double the value predicted by the empirical model over the whole crop rotation (115% and 133%, Table 2), for which mainly the low model performance for maize accounts. –17%, sorghum: –17% and Both models largely agree in pattern during periods where growth conditions were suboptimal (Figs. 4 and 5). For maize, MONICA simulates higher GPP rates than the empirical model throughout the season (Fig. 6). For rye and sorghum, MONICA simulates episodically lower GPP rates than the empirical model, coinciding with periods of drought stress hampering plant growth. The patterns differ most (i) directly after harvest, when MONICA simulates still signiﬁcant respiration rates which originate from the immediate onset of plant residue decomposition in soil (Fig. 7) while the empirical model does not, and (ii) during bare soil X.

Discussion Both modelling approaches reproduce reasonable CO2 ex- change rates in the range of the measured values, although at a small temporal resolution considerable differences are noted for individual CO2 ﬂuxes. Observed CO2 ﬂuxes originate from short- term (seconds to minutes) measurements and the temporal scaling to produce daily values to compare with the daily time step simulations of the process-based model requires empirical models, whose performance is put to test at the same time. However, apart from the drivers temperature and radiation considered in the empirical model, the other main drivers of ecosystem CO2 exchange, i.e. plant biomass and soil moisture, can be considered stable for the duration of a single day. Hence, for the actual day of measurement, rate derived by the daily CO2 exchange ^: campaign dates of high-frequency CO2 contrasting terrain positions using an empirical and a process-based agro-ecosystem model.

Top: terrain depression, bottom: hill slope. temperature- and radiation-dependent empirical modelling based on 30–50 chamber measurements can be assumed as being representative of true CO2 exchange rates. For the purpose of model comparison, the empirical data from the actual measure- ment campaigns can thus be used as reference to evaluate the MONICA estimates, while the true CO2 exchange rates during the gap-ﬁlling periods are unknown and no reference level is available. 4.1. Gap-ﬁlling method the linear (Moffat et al., 2007), The empirical model of Hoffmann et al. (2015b) was developed as a gap-ﬁlling method in order to produce a continuous time series of CO2 gas exchange data for a soil–plant system based on periodic chamber measurements. While gap-ﬁlling of CO2 ﬂux data based on temperature (Reco) and radiation (NEE) is generally accepted interpolation of empirically modelled CO2 exchange rates between consecutive measurement campaigns relies on the inherent assumption of linear biomass development. Depending on the time period between two consecutive measurement campaigns, this assump- tion may be violated in times of rapid plant development such as often noted during shoot elongation, potentially underestimating plant photosynthetic activity and thus GPP when interpolation spans longer periods unsupported by measurements. Campaign frequency should therefore be increased in times of rapid plant growth, or plant biomass introduced as an empirical modelling parameter. In addition, empirical temperature- and radiation- ﬁtted when the diurnal dependent models often cannot be temperature or PAR variability is small, resulting in average CO2 exchange rates being extrapolated over several weeks. This applies especially to the winter period, in which either no crop was planted or low temperatures allowed only very reduced biological activity. However, although the relative error of the empirically derived CO2 exchange rates may be large, particularly during periods of low activity insufﬁciently supported by measurements, this difference is assumed neglectable in absolute terms. These issues have previously been recognised and addressed by Hoffmann et al. (2015b), who therefore included both a calibration and a validation procedure in their empirical approach to quantify the uncertainty arising from inappropriate campaign spacing as well as lacking ﬁt. While the former procedure analyses discrepancies model ﬂux data using between measured and simulated half-hourly goodness-of-ﬁt indices, the latter evaluates the effects of campaign spacing on the CO2 ﬂux estimates by omitting data entire ﬁnal empirical model via measurement campaigns from the leave-one-out cross-validation. The overall quality of CO2 exchange data estimated with the campaign-based empirical approach is therefore highly dependent on the frequency and the spacing of the CO2 measurement campaigns in relation to the respective crop and its development. 4.2. Process-based simulation In contrast to the empirical model, a process-based simulation ﬂux rates in which every data point model delivers a time series of has the same weight, as there is no difference between supporting points and calculated values. During times of limited crop growth or absence of a crop, a process-based model produces values of similar accuracy, well reﬂecting the response of soil microbial activity and, if applicable, gas transport processes through the soil to environmental conditions. For doing so, however, the process- based model needs to be able to reproduce (i) soil organic matter decomposition, (ii) crop phenology, and (iii) crop growth the best possible, since these factors especially the timing of crop growth – are conditions sine qua non for crop-related gas exchange – simulations. For the ﬁrst precondition, it was ensured by means of calibration that MONICA assumes soil organic matter decomposi- tion rates which agree with long-term data obtained from the same agro-climatic zone. The test against the long- term SOC data set revealed that SOC decline was 23.3% slower than assumed by the original parametrisation, which represented the ‘Müncheberg V140’ X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 SOC dynamics from the Askov long-term experiment in Denmark (Bruun et al., 2003). The Askov soils are sandy loam soils, while at Müncheberg loamy sands prevail. Hints exists that in sandy soils decomposition of soil organic matter is slower (Bimüller et al., ﬁner textured soils may 2014) and model parameters derived from not perform sufﬁciently well (Heumann and Böttcher, 2004). With regard to measured and simulated Rh, the decomposition of the slow pool (recalcitrant soil organic matter) is not assumed to contribute signiﬁcantly to the CO2 emission from soil. This test and calibration procedure is merely seen as a demonstration of MONICA simulations of short-term soil CO2 production being well in agreement with long-term SOC dynamics. Short-term organic matter turnover (e.g. plant residues) has been sufﬁciently tested for the DAISY model before (Müller et al., 2003). The second precondition for a successful reproduction of measured CO2 gas exchange rates is an accurate representation of crop phenology. Process-based crop models, such as MONICA, calculate crop phenology, including seedling emergence, based on environmental conditions and may fail in doing so. In the case of the presented experiment, MONICA assumed earlier emergence of ﬁeld, since the conditions that hampered maize as observed in the undisturbed emergence could not be introduced to the model due to the respective algorithms not being implemented. By means of parameter adjustment (thermal time until emergence) MONICA was forced to simulate maize emergence later in order to better match the observed emergence date. The third precondition is the accurate simulation of plant biomass and also here crop models could do wrong, especially if the model has been calibrated to different genotypes or different environments (Bassu et al., 2014; Martre et al., 2015). Crop modelling at larger scales or under scenario conditions may accept larger deviations since the use of several temporal or spatial replicates may help reducing uncertainty. In fact, quantifying the uncertainty may be one of the goals of model predictions (Asseng et al., 2013). In case of the reproduction of plot-scale crop growth, even minimal errors may lead to refusal of the result, especially if errors in crop growth simulation entail even larger errors in subordinate analyses. This also applies to the simulation of CO2 exchange rates, which largely depends on the simulation of crop growth. 4.3. Site effects and other inﬂuencing factors from For the sites under investigation, the terrain position has a signiﬁcant effect on crop growth (Hoffmann et al., 2015a), which is mostly due to differences in water supply at the slope and in the ﬂow and run- syncline, the latter collecting water from subsurface off the circumjacent slopes and exhibiting shallower groundwater table (Hook and Burke, 2000; Manning et al., 2001; Priyashantha et al., 2007). Only in cases of excess rainfall, the water supply in the depression can produce adverse growth conditions due to O2 deﬁciency in the root zone (Grant, 2004). For crop models not considering groundwater levels, the risk of failure in simulating crop growth at such sites is particularly high (Kersebaum and Nendel, 2014). In addition to this, erosion-induced differences in SOM contents exhibit correlating differences in natural nutrient supply via SOM mineralisation. While crop models often consider this circumstance with respect to nitrogen, there may be considerable effects of other nutrients (P, K, Mg and micro- nutrients) which currently available models do not account for. All in all, there seem to be many factors related to accurate modelling of soil organic matter decomposition, crop phenology, and crop growth that could overthrow uncalibrated simulation attempts. The application of a process-based model without prior calibration may therefore lead to substantial miscarriage of C balance calculations. However, in studies where detailed plot-scale CO2 ﬂux simulations are not required to derive more general statements, the uncertainties introduced by the crop growth algorithms may be considered neglectable. 4.4. Comparison of the two models Depending on the research question, the lack of prediction accuracy of a process-based model may be more than compensat- ﬂux components provided by ed by the additional information on C the process-based model compared to empirical models. Field CO2 measurements can only directly measure Reco and NEE, from which the empirical model then derives a complete time series of GPP. A ﬂuxes, sophisticated process-based model can separate different C such as maintenance (Rm) and growth (Rg) respiration, also speciﬁc to individual plant organs. Using MONICA, even the contribution of root respiration can be simulated as a separate contribution to what is measured as bulk soil respiration, originating from respiring roots and microorganisms and from CO2-producing extracellular enzyme activity (Blankinship et al., 2014). Restric- tively, it has to be added that most process-based agro-ecosystem models have not yet been sufﬁciently parameterised at this level of detail and derive root respiration from root biomass using an organ-speciﬁc respiration rate. Moreover, transfer of C compounds from the plant to the soil via exudates prior to their decomposition in the rhizosphere is rarely implemented in such models (Personeni et al., 2007; Toal et al., 2000). In the current example, MONICA simulates an immediate onset of crop residue decomposition after harvest, resulting in a CO2 peak already on the following day. Again, conceptual simpliﬁcations in the model limit the reproduction of the timing of plant tissue decomposition, neglecting that microbes require some time to colonise dead plant material before notable decomposition commences. MONICA assumes all above- and below-ground plant residues being in the soil immediately after harvest and neither physical nor biochemical constraints for immediate degradation. This is why MONICA differs most signiﬁcantly from the empirical model during the short period right after harvest. However, as no ploughing or other soil preparation took place immediately following harvest and incorporated the harvest residues into the soil, the empirically derived time series is assumed to be more realistic for this period. the A second period of considerable inter-model differences is noted during winter, when biological and biochemical activity is greatly reduced due to low temperatures, and the presence or absence of a crop has only a negligible absolute effect on CO2 exchange rates. As a result of lacking model-ﬁt and resulting linear interpolation, the values simulated by the empirical model show extremely low variability during winter and are almost constant after the harvest of sorghum. In contrast, MONICA simulates a – ﬂux series which reﬂects the more responsive existing diurnal variability of temperatures and hence microbial activity, and thus seems more realistic. However, both approaches simulate very low winter CO2 exchange rates and, even though the deviation between both simulations is large relative to the mean of prediction, it is almost neglectable in the context of the seasonal CO2 exchange. albeit small – 5. Conclusion The two modelling approaches differ in scope, which is why a performance comparison does not bring up a champion. Teaming up, both approaches do contribute to the analysis of CO2 exchange their speciﬁc for a plant–soil system with measurements ﬁlling gaps between and strengths: the empirical model by temporal scaling of campaign-based short-term CO2 measure- ments and the process-based model in interpreting subordinate, X. Specka et al. / Soil & Tillage Research 156 (2016) 219–229 ﬂuxes and spatial scaling of CO2 exchange non-measured C dynamics. Information about plant development and the resulting dynamics of ecosystem CO2 exchange derived from MONICA could be integrated with the measured data to support the empirical model when campaign spacing cannot be intensiﬁed for technical reasons or data is lacking in certain periods. While MONICA itself may not be suitable to simulate and capture differences in the ecosystem CO2 exchange of individual plots, such as different soil preparation or fertilisation treatments, the temporally dynamic data from MONICA could complement the empirical modelling approach to generate improved plot-speciﬁc CO2 and C budgets. Another possible path ahead towards an improved tool for calculating regional C budgets on the basis of simulations could be the use of MONICA after a calibration against CO2 ﬂux simulations produced by the empirical model. Such calibration would then include respiration and photosynthesis parameters, going beyond the set of parameters usually touched in a calibration procedure (Rötter et al., 2012; Specka et al., 2015). MONICA already demonstrated its potential in reproducing a similar pattern as the benchmark model and further calibration may put MONICA in the position to be used for independent simulations of CO2 ﬂuxes in agro-ecosystems in future studies. However, some parts of the C cycle represented further validation, which includes below-ground C export from the crop to the soil and organ-speciﬁc photosynthesis and respiration. For a more general prediction of the impact of changing environmental conditions on the C budget of an agro-ecosystem MONICA may already be declared in MONICA should be subject to ﬁt for purpose.
