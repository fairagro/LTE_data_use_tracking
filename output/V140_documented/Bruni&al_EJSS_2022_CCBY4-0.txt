The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase SOC stocks by 4‰ at 16 long-term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (EOM) additions. We used an ensemble of six SOC models and ran them under two configura- tions: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site- by-site to fit the evolution of SOC stocks in the control treatments (without EOM). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the SOC stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on (cid:1)1 average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 ± 1.2 Mg C ha to increase SOC stocks by 4‰ per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi-model median ± median standard deviation (cid:1)1 year across sites). That is, a 119% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial SOC stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water-related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated.

To increase the reliability of SOC models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water-related variables on SOC decomposition. Highlights: (cid:129) The feasibility of the 4‰ target was studied at 16 long-term agricultural experiments. (cid:129) An ensemble of soil organic carbon models was used to estimate the uncer- tainty of the predictions. (cid:129) On average across the sites, carbon input had to increase by 119% compared to initial conditions. (cid:129) High uncertainty of the simulations was mainly driven by water-related variables. K E Y W O R D S 4 per 1000 initiative, agriculture, carbon sequestration, climate change, European targets, multi-modelling, soil organic carbon The latest report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Cli- mate Change (IPCC, 2021) announced observed changes in the whole climate system in every region across the world. Although many of the changes already set in motion are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years, strong and sustained reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) could still limit climate change (IPCC, 2021). Additional efforts to decrease the level of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other GHGs in the atmosphere are expected from land-based mitigation solutions. The European Commission has recently released a set of targets for European soil health (e.g., COM(2020) 381 final; COM(2021) 800 final; SWD(2021) 450 final) (European Com- mission, 2020, 2021a, 2021b), which includes the contribution of soils to climate change mitigation via increased atmo- spheric carbon (C) sequestration. These targets aim to reverse the current average decline of soil organic carbon (SOC) in (cid:1)1) to a 1‰-4‰ annual European croplands (i.e., 5‰ year increase (Veerman et al., 2020). With the same perspective, the “4 per 1000” initiative has gathered contributions from hundreds of partners across the world since 2015, to promote agricultural practices that help to maintain or enrich culti- vated soils in organic C, including those which reduce the mineralization of organic C and increase its stocks in soils (Minasny et al., 2017). This will have the combined effect of improving soil quality (e.g., soil fertility and water retention) (Lal, 2008) while mitigating climate change through increased C sequestration in the soil. Despite the multiple benefits provided by increasing SOC stocks, the feasibility of a 4‰ objective with current agricultural management practices is still under debate (e.g., Chabbi et al., 2017; Rumpel et al., 2020; Soussana et al., 2019; van Groenigen et al., 2017). Recently, some studies using process-based models focused on the bio-technical feasibility of SOC stock increase targets, such as the 4‰ objective (e.g., Bruni et al., 2021; Martin et al., 2021; Riggers et al., 2021). Individual model predictions of a 4‰ increase target in Europe are relatively optimistic. That is, a required 30 to 40% C input increase in France according to Martin et al. (2021), and a 43% increase in European long-term experiments (LTEs) according to Bruni et al. (2021) under present climate conditions. A multi- modelling exercise from Riggers et al. (2021) predicted a much larger increase for German croplands, that is a 213–283% increase of C input required between 2090 and 2099, compared to 2014, under different climate change sce- narios. Multi-model ensemble means are expected to provide improved estimates compared to singular model simulations, due to the relative independence of different SOC models' simulation errors (IPCC, 2007). Furthermore, simulations designed with multiple models that have underlying struc- tural differences provide an uncertainty range of SOC projec- tions that reflects our current understanding of SOC processes and their possible representations. The use of multi-model ensembles to predict the evolution of complex systems is a widespread practice in other disciplines, such as climate modelling (Jebeile & Crucifix, 2020; Parker, 2010; Tebaldi & Knutti, 2007). Although some efforts have been made in the soil modelling community to embrace this 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

In the present paper, we aim to (1) use a multi-model ensemble to simulate the SOC stock evolution in long-term cropland experiments, and evaluate two multi-model ensemble configurations, one with default model parame- ters and the other with parameters calibrated site-by-site, (2) provide an estimate of the C input required to annually increase SOC stocks by 4‰ in 16 LTEs across Europe, and (3) identify potential factors creating uncertainty across models. With this work, we want to contribute to the understanding of the feasibility of a 4‰ SOC stock increase target in Europe, and to add a piece to the ongoing discus- sion about the use of multi-model ensembles in soil science. | M A T E R I A L S A N D M E T H O D S 2.1 | Experimental sites The dataset used in this study compiles 16 long-term cropland experiments located in Europe (9 in France and 1 each in Spain, Great Britain, Sweden, Italy, Germany, Poland and Austria). Each experiment includes one or several treatments with the addition of exogenous organic material (EOM) and a control treatment without any EOM addition, but with the same crops and fertiliser inputs. In total, the database included 43 EOM treat- ments and 16 controls. The data consists of several mea- surements of SOC content and its variance across replicates, yearly crop yields and different soil character- istics (Table A1). The experiments lasted on average 26 years (median of 21 years), in the period between 1956 and 2018. EOM inputs were applied to the soil at differ- ent rates and frequencies and varied from animal manure (swine, bovine and poultry) to sewage sludge, peats, cas- tor meal, sawdust, bio waste, green manure and house- hold waste (i.e., residual organic material generated from residential waste). Data for the Bologna experiment were directly extracted from Triberti et al. (2008) and consisted of the average SOC stock evolution in different inorganic nitrogen (N) experiments (i.e., one treatment without any inorganic fertiliser and 3 treatments with different levels of N input). Cropping systems (Table A2) were cereal-dominated rotations (wheat, maize, barley and oat). In particular, four were monocultures of forage crops or cereals (silage maize in Champ Noël 3, Le Rheu 1 and Le Rheu 2 and winter wheat in Broadbalk) and five sites had rotations of different cereals (winter wheat and silage or grain maize in Crécom 3 PRO, Feucherolles, La Jaillière 2 PRO, Avrillé and Bologna). The other experiments rotated cereal crops with legumes (chickpea, pea) and/or root crops (potatoes, fodder beet, fodder rape and Swedish tur- nip), oilseed crops (oilseed flax, sunflower, oilseed rape, and mustard), and cover crops (ryegrass). Except for Müncheberg which was irrigated in 4 out of 8 replicates between 1974 and 1981, all experiments were rainfed and managed under conventional tillage (the Ultuna trial was tilled by hand with a spade to mimic conventional till- age). Straw residues were exported from the field, except in the French and Austrian sites, where residues were partly or totally incorporated into the soil. In the French experiments Champ Noël 3, Crécom 3 PRO, La Jaillière 2 PRO, Le Rheu1 and Trévarez received optimal amounts of mineral N fertilisers both in the control and in the treatments. In the Polish experiment of Grab(cid:1)ow, N, phos- phorus (P), and potassium (K) were applied. 2.2 | Climate forcing Daily soil surface temperature, moisture and potential evapotranspiration (PET) were simulated for each site using the land-surface model ORCHIDEE (Krinner et al., 2005). Simulations were run using a 3-hourly global climate dataset at 0.5(cid:3) (GSWP3 http://hydro.iis.u-tokyo. ac.jp/GSWP3/), from which were also derived daily pre- cipitation data. Mean annual temperature (MAST) during the experiments ranged between 5.7(cid:3)C and 12.8(cid:3)C across the sites, while mean annual precipita- tion (MAP) was 850 mm, with a minimum of 613 mm and a maximum of 1314 mm (Table A3). The virtual amount of C input required to increase SOC stocks was analysed over the period 1980–2010, which was the 30-yearlong interval the experiments. covering the majority of surface 2.3 | Soil sampling Soil samples were collected between 0–20 and 0–40 cm depth, in 3 to 8 replicates. In Champ Noël 3, replicates were not available, and in Broadbalk, SOC was sampled using a semi-cylindrical auger, bulking together 10–20 cores from across the plot. SOC stocks were calculated using the standard formula: (cid:1) (cid:3) (cid:1)1 SOC Mg C ha ¼ SOC %ð (cid:1) Þ (cid:4) BD g cm(cid:1)3 (cid:3) (cid:4) sampling depth cmð Þ ð (cid:4) 1 (cid:1) coarse fragments fraction vol:%=100 ð Þ Þ, where SOC (%) is the concentration of organic C in the the soil and BD is the average bulk density of 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

BD across the sites ranged between 1.1 and 1.7 g cm(cid:1)3. Its evolution over time in the EOM treat- ments was not taken into account due to lack of data for all experiments. In Ritzlhof, BD measurements were not available. Hence, for this site we estimated BD using the intrinsically linear pedotransfer function developed by Kaur et al. (2002), using clay, silt, and organic C content in the soil. We compared the value of BD obtained with this method to LUCAS soil maps (Ballabio et al., 2016) and found similar results. Clay content ranged from 5% to 36%, while soil pH varied from 5.8 to 8.6 across the sites. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) content was relevant in Arazuri, Colmar, Grab(cid:1)ow and Broadbalk soils (160, 130, 77 and 20 gCaCO3 soil respectively), while the rest of the sites had none or negligible quantities of CaCO3. (cid:4) kg (cid:1)1 2.4 | Multi-model ensemble et al., 2015) and Millennial Six SOC models were used for the multi-model ensemble 1988), Roth-C (Parton et analysis: Century al., (Coleman & Jenkinson, 1996), ICBM (Andrén & Kätterer, 1997), AMG (Andriulo et al., 1999), MIMICS (Abramoff (Wieder et al., 2022). All six models take as input C from plant lit- ter and other organic material and focus on the dynamics of C within a single soil layer (0–30 cm). Four of the models (i.e., Century, Roth-C, ICBM and AMG) represent conventional multi- soil C dynamics compartmental structure, where C is decomposed follow- ing first-order decay rates. The number of equations (and compartments) differs from model to model. The remain- ing two more recent models (i.e., MIMICS and Millen- nial) have microbial explicit C pools, where the turnover of litter and SOC pools is governed by temperature- sensitive Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Each model was initialised with the standard modelling practice which is commonly used for the model, and using methods that reduced the running time of the spin-up (e.g., the semi- analytical spin-up for Century and Roth-C). using a The model contains one fresh organic matter pool and two SOC pools (active and stable). The stable pool is con- sidered constant throughout the simulation length, while the other pools decayed at an annual rate. Both Roth-C and Century models were solved semi-analytically, fol- lowing the method described by Huang et al. (2018) and Xia et al. (2012). The method consists of (1) solving the set of differential equations by inverse calculations to determine pool sizes at steady state and (2) running the model numerically for the rest of the simulation. Century has four litter pools (structural and metabolic above- ground litter C and structural and metabolic below- ground litter C) and three SOC pools (active, slow and passive), which differ in their decomposition rates. It was run at a daily time step. Roth-C simulates the SOC evolu- tion with a monthly time step and was converted into its matrix continuous form following Parshotam (1996). The model has five pools: decomposable and resistant plant material (DPM and RPM), microbial biomass, humified organic matter (HUM) and inert organic C. This latter pool is constant through time and is calculated from the level of SOC at the experiment the beginning of (Coleman & Jenkinson, 1996). Both MIMICS and Millen- nial models were initialised using a Newton–Raphson approach that calculates the steady-state of the C pools analytically (stode function of the rootSolve package in R [Soetaert & Herman, 2009]). They were run numerically afterwards. MIMICS has seven SOC pools: two litter C pools that correspond to metabolic and structural litter, two microbial pools and three soil organic matter (SOM) pools (a physically protected, a bio-chemically recalci- trant and an available SOM pool). The Millennial model has five measurable pools of C: particulate organic matter (POM), low molecular weight C (LMWC), aggregate C, mineral-associated organic matter, and microbial bio- mass C (MIC). Both models were run at a daily time step. 2.5 | Calibration of model parameters ICBM is run at an annual time step and can be solved analytically due to the linearity of its system of equations. The model consists of two compartments: a young and an old SOC pool. Environmental factors are summarised into one coefficient (r) that affects the decomposition rates of both soil compartments equally. The response functions for the temperature and moisture used to calcu- late the parameter r, which had to be normalised against the Ultuna experiment, were derived from Fortin et al. (2011) and Karlsson et al. (2011). Following its standard initialization method (Saffih-Hdadi & Mary, 2008), AMG was initialised using the value of SOC during the first year of the experiments and run numerically afterwards. All models were run with two configurations: (1) using default parameters and (2) using calibrated parameters that were optimised site by site in order to fit the evolu- tion of observed SOC stocks in the control treatments. Century, Roth-C, ICBM and AMG were coded in python (a link to the codes is provided at the end of the manu- script for all models), and the calibration of their parame- least-squares ters was performed using the sequential quadratic programming function in Python (SciPy v1.5.1, scipy. optimise package with method = “SLSQP”), a non- linear constrained, gradient-based optimization algo- rithm (Fu et al., 2019). MIMICS and Millennial were coded in R, and to optimise these models the limited- 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

Fol- lowing Bruni et al. (2021), we calibrated the Q10 and reference temperature factors (Tref), after calibrating the metabolic: structural litter ratio of the aboveground (M:SAG) and belowground (M:SBG) litter pools. These latter parameters are used to partition the C input into the different litter pools and are a function of the nitro- gen: lignin (N:L) ratio of the plants. They were opti- mised since no data was available on the N:L ratio of the different crops. SOC decomposition in Roth-C is also sensitive to the temperature response function, which is an empirical function initially built for the (Jenkinson, 1990). We cali- Rothamsted experiment brated the temperature function parameter (Tparam) for each experimental site. In MIMICS, we calibrated the tuning coefficients (av and ak) of the temperature- sensitive kinetic parameters, on which the rates of C decomposition depend. As in Century, we also cali- brated the parameter that is used to partition litter inputs into their metabolic and structural fraction (fmet). In Millennial, we optimised (1) the activation energy (Eapl) and (2) the half-saturation constant (Kpl) of the maximum rate of POM decomposition, and (3) the activation energy (Ealb) of the maximum uptake rate of the LMWC pool. Both activation energies are parameters in an Arrhenius temperature relationship and are linked to the decomposition of POM into LMWC and to the microbial uptake of LMWC (Abramoff et al., 2022). The performance of the models was evaluated by test- ing the similarity between simulated and observed SOC stocks in the control treatments, in terms of (1) their cor- relation (ρ), (2) their standard deviation (SD) normalised against the SD of the observations, and (3) their centred root-mean-squared error also normalised against the SD of the observations, which is a measure of the prediction's error (Taylor, 2001). Note that the corre- lation between observed and simulated SOC stocks was tested with Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (ρ) follow a normal the because distribution. variables did not (RMSE), Carbon input from plant material was calculated from annual crop yield measurements, following the method developed by Bolinder et al. (2007) for Canadian experi- ments and adapted by Clivot et al. (2019) to the same French experiments used in this study. The allometric functions used to estimate the C input and its allocation to the aboveground and belowground part of the plant can be found in Clivot et al. (2019) and have already been applied to other agricultural experiments in European temperate climates such as those in our study (Bruni et al., 2021). | Required C input to increase SOC 2.6 stocks by 4‰ per year SOC stocks were simulated for each control treatment over the experiments' duration to evaluate the capability of the models to reproduce observed SOC stocks. The period 1980–2010 was selected to analyse the virtual amount of additional C input required to increase the SOC stocks. We simulated one scenario of SOC stock evo- lution, where SOC stocks increased on average by 4‰ (cid:1)1 for 30 years, relative to the initial SOC stocks in year the control treatments. The amount of C input required to increase SOC stocks by the defined target was calculated using an inverse modelling approach that consisted in minimising the following equation: J ¼ j SOC0 model (cid:4) target (cid:1) SOC30 model Ið Þj model and SOC30 model are the modelled SOC where SOC0 stocks at the onset of the experiment and after 30 years of simulations, respectively; I is the simulated C input required to reach the target, and target = 1.12 (i.e., 1 + 0.004 (cid:6) 30) since the objective was to reach an average (cid:1)1 for 30 years. We used SOC stock increase of 4‰ year the Python function SLSQP to solve the optimization problem. Carbon input quality is accounted for differ- ently in the different models. In Millennial, regardless of its quality 1/3 of the C input is allocated to POM and the rest 2/3 to LMWC (Abramoff et al., 2022). In Century and MIMICS, the allocation of the C input to the metabolic and structural litter pools depends on the L:N ratio of the C input material. Hence, the C input quality can be inferred by the M:S ratio of the C input. For these models, during the optimization process, we did not prescribe the quality of the C input since the optimization directly simulated the optimal allocation of C in the different litter pools to reach the 4‰ target. However, for Century, we constrained the virtual C input to have the same aboveground: below- ground ratio as the initial litter inputs, assuming that crops would not change with the 4‰ implementation and that the EOM would be equally split above and below the soil surface (see Bruni et al., 2021). In AMG and ICBM, the humification coefficient h varies according to the quality of the C input. For instance, in AMG h = 0.217 for aboveground winter wheat and h = 0.52 for cow manure (Bouthier et al., 2014). In ICBM, h = 0.125 for straw and crop residues and h = 0.31 for farmyard manure (FYM) (Andrén & Kätterer, 1997).

For these three models, a fraction f of the estimated C input was set to have the same quality as the litter input in the control treatment (i.e., its parame- trization or its allocation to the different pools). The remaining 1 (cid:1) f Þ fraction of C input was set to have the average quality of the EOM in the different treatments at the experimental site. For example, for AMG a site with initial litter input from winter wheat equal to 2 Mg C (cid:1)1 in the control treatment, and with a cow ha manure treatment only, a fraction f ¼ 2=I was set to have aboveground h = 0.217 and the remaining fraction 1 (cid:1) f Þ was set to have aboveground h = 0.52, where I is ð the estimated C input required to reach the 4‰ and where the maximum value of f was set to be 1. Both non- calibrated and calibrated models were run independently to estimate the amount of C input to reach the 4‰ target at the 16 experimental sites. (cid:1)1 year 2.7 | Comparison of models outputs Model outputs were compared using different techniques. First, we tested whether the models and the calibration affected the simulated C input needed to reach the 4‰ target across the 16 sites. This was done using a linear mixed-effect (LME) model, with fixed effects for the explanatory variables: “model”, “calibration” and the interaction between the two, and including a random effect for “sites”. The model was fit by maximising the log-likelihood and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied to test the effect of the different explanatory vari- the ables on the simulated C input. Normality of residuals was tested using a Shapiro–Wilk normality test, and homoscedasticity was tested using Levene's test of equality of variances. Since the residuals were not nor- mally distributed, the data were log-transformed. Second, we looked for groups of models that behaved similarly. We created clusters based on the minimum correlation distance between models' outputs (i.e., the additional C input to reach the 4‰ target). The distance was calcu- lated with an optimization algorithm based on a mini- mum spanning tree (Müller et al., 2012). To estimate which measured variables better explained the differ- ences between the model outputs, we used a linear model and tested for the normality of the residuals using a Shapiro–Wilk test. The explanatory variables of the linear model were: MAST, MAP, PET, initial C input (Cin 0 ), clay and CaCO3 content, soil C:N and pH, initial SOC stocks and N input (Nin). This latter was considered as a cate- gorical variable, equal to 1 if N inputs were applied at any dose and 0 otherwise. The response variable was the relative standard deviation (RSD) among models' outputs (RSD = SD/mean (cid:4) 100). To select the most parsimonious model, we performed a step-wise regression by Akaike Information Criteria (AIC). The results for the multi- model ensembles are provided as their multi-model median (MMM) and mean. | R E S U L T S | Evaluation of the multi-model 3.1 ensemble configurations: Prediction of the SOC stocks in the control treatments Observed SOC stocks in the control treatments, that is, plots without EOM additions were found to Predicted and observed soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (Mg C ha F I G U R E 1 (different colours and shapes) with: (a) non-calibrated and (b) calibrated parameters.

In particular, the calibration of model parameters improved the representation of observed SOC stocks in the control treatments (coefficient of determination, R2 = 0.97) (Figure 1b), compared to the non-calibrated configuration (R2 = 0.07) (Figure 1a).

While AMG performed better than in the non-calibrated configuration any other model (i.e., R2 = 0.90 and RMSE = 5.46), in the calibrated con- figuration both ICBM and AMG outperformed the other models with the highest R2 (0.98) and the lowest RMSE (cid:1)1) (Table 2).

In the non-calibrated configuration, the effect of additional C input on the SOC stocks was overestimated by the MMM. On the contrary, the calibrated MMM was not significantly different from the EOM treatments' regression line. This means that, in the calibrated multi-model ensemble configuration, the predicted effect of additional C input on the SOC stocks was close to observations, when compared to the 43 EOM treatments of the 16 experimental sites. Comparing the CI of the MMMs, we can also appreciate that the predic- tions of the non-calibrated and calibrated configurations were significantly different from each other (Figure 3). | Required C input to reach a 4‰ 3.3 target to reach the average 4‰ annual increase of SOC stocks, relative to the initial level of C input in the control treat- ment.

The median site variability of the required additional C input was higher calibrated ensemble in the (RSD = 66.2%), compared to the non-calibrated ensemble (RSD = 40.2%) (Table 4).

The dendrogram at the top of the figure clusters the models based on the minimal correlation dis- tance among simulated C input. What can be appreciated from the graph is that there are two main groups of models that behave similarly when calibrated. The first cluster is formed between the AMG and ICBM models. The second cluster incorporates MIMICS, Century, Roth-C and Millennial (the correlation between the first two models being higher than between the others). The the stepwise AIC algorithm showed that, results of among the non-calibrated models, different variables had a significant effect (p < 0.05) on the RSD between simu- lated C input (i.e., initial SOC stocks, MAST and initial C input (Cin 0 )) (Table 6). When the models were calibrated, the RSD among the simulated C input was explained by water-related variables only, is, MAP and PET (Table 6). that | DISCUSSION | Evaluation of the multi-model 4.1 ensemble configurations The calibration of model parameters improved the simu- lation of SOC stocks in the control treatments of the 16 LTEs used in this study (Figure 1). In a multi- modelling exercise, Farina et al. (2021) showed that site- specific calibration improved the simulation of SOC stocks in 7 bare-fallow LTEs in Europe. This was true both compared to a non-calibrated and to a multi-site cal- ibration configuration (i.e., where generic parameters are optimised for all sites together). Site-specific calibration accounts for the spatial variability of model parameters across sites. However, in order to avoid overfitting, site- specific calibration requires sufficient repeated SOC mea- surements for each site, especially for models with many parameters. In our study, the calibration was also validated against the effect of C input on SOC stocks. In fact, the calibrated multi-model ensemble better reproduced the effect of C input on SOC stocks in the 43 EOM treatments, compared to the non-calibrated configuration (Figure 3). In particu- lar, we found that the MMM additional C input to reach the 4‰ simulated by the calibrated configuration was not significantly different from the observations (p < 0.05), whereas the non-calibrated and calibrated ensembles were different from each other at a statistically significant level (Figure 3).

On the other hand, the vari- ability of the predicted C input across models was decreased by the calibration (i.e., RSD across models was 67.9% in the non-calibrated and 48.8% in the calibrated re-parametrization configuration), meaning that decreased the uncertainty of the predictions. the | Single model performances 4.2 and MMM Considering both configurations, AMG had the highest indices of performance (Table 2). However, AMG's com- parison with the other models might be partly biased, because when the model was initially developed it was cal- ibrated on several LTEs across France, which include many of the experiments in our database. Hence, we can- not ascertain that its application to other sites outside the European temperate zone would be as straightforward, although the model has already been evaluated on a few sites outside Europe (Andriulo et al., 1999; Saffih-Hdadi & Mary, 2008). AMG was also the only model initialised with observed initial SOC stocks, while the other models were spun-up either analytically or semi-analytically. This has enabled the model to capture the correct level of initial SOC stocks, lending it an advantage in the model compari- son. In fact, AMG prescribes the initial fraction of total SOC that is considered stable (Saffih-Hdadi & Mary, 2008). That is, 65% of the total initial SOC stocks for sites with a long history of arable land use (Clivot et al., 2019). Most pool-based models do not prescribe default partitioning in the different SOC pools at the beginning of the experi- ment. Hence, initialization to allocate the C in their differ- ent pools is typically done by running the models with constant or repeating inputs until the C pools reach equi- librium (i.e., spin-up). The amount of C allocated to each pool at equilibrium is a function of the inputs to the model and the parameters. Spin-up assumes that soils are at equi- librium (Luo et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2012), which is often not the case, especially for the agricultural soils with changing management practices considered in this study. Hence, simulations might be started at the wrong initial values (e.g., Wutzler & Reichstein, 2007). In particular, the level of stable or low decomposition rate C pools might influence the SOC stock predictions in the long-term and could partially explain the differences in the required C input predicted by the models. Table 3 shows that the ini- tial level of the low decomposition rate pools depends on how these pools are defined in the models. In particular, Roth-C showed the lowest proportion of C in its inert pool, which is calculated with the equation from Falloon et al. (1998) and considered constant throughout the simulation length. Roth-C and AMG are the only models with a completely inert pool. However, in Roth-C the humified C (cid:1)1, pool also has a low decomposition rate (i.e., 0.02 year which means that the C takes 50 years to decompose). 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

Hence, model comparisons are difficult without consider- ing intrinsic differences across all pools. An alternative ini- called tialization method that can be applied is “relaxation” (Dimassi et al., 2018). This method consists of rescaling the SOC stocks allocated in the different pools the total through spin-up, using information about 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

Due to the form of our problem (i.e., inverse modelling requiring us to keep the relation- ship between C input and SOC stock unchanged), this method could not be used. Another approach that could be tested to compare model performances using observed initial total SOC stocks would be to prescribe a priori the initial partitioning of SOC in the different pools of those models that are usually initialised with spin-up. An attempt was made for instance with Roth-C in an Australian catchment (Karunaratne et al., 2014). How- ever, this method has proven complicated and nongenera- lizable for models based on conceptual SOC pools (e.g., Sohi et al., 2001), and the scientific community has rather focused on building new modelling frameworks based on measurable pools (e.g., MEMS, Millennial) (Abramoff et al., 2022; Cotrufo et al., 2013). Initializing models with measurable SOC fractions requires additional the main drawbacks of such data, which is one of approaches. After calibration, the models overall performed well, (cid:1)1. Other with an R2 ≥ 0.92 and an RMSE <4.6 Mg C ha than initialization and parametrization, limitations in model predictions could also be explained by the forcing data used and the processes described in the models. For example, previous land use or current management prac- tices, which are likely to influence the level of SOC stocks at the onset of the experiment, were not prescribed in the models. AMG not only outperformed all other models in the non-calibrated configuration, but it also performed better than the MMM in both configurations (Table 2). Tebaldi and Knutti (2007) pointed out that, while for a single given simulation the multi-model performance might not be significantly better than the single best model, improvements are more substantial when aggregated per- formances over many simulations are considered. Of course, as the multi-model ensemble gets larger, the esti- mates will be more reliable. Farina et al. (2021) suggested that the minimum number of models to obtain reliable results in SOC modelling would be (cid:8)10 models for non- calibrated multi-model ensembles, and 3 to 4 models if site-specific calibration is realisable. However, this likely depends on how much the structure varies among the multi-model ensemble. 4.3 | Reaching a 4‰ target Many recent works have studied the feasibility of the 4‰ target through a modelling perspective. Martin et al. (2021) estimated that a 30% to 40% increase in C input would be needed to reach a 4‰ objective in France, using an inverse Roth-C modelling approach. Bruni et al. (2021) used a similar inverse modelling approach to the Century model and applied it to 14 LTEs across Europe. They estimated that C input should increase by 43% on average, compared to the initial value of the experimental control treatments. These results are similar to our esti- mates from the calibrated Roth-C and Century models (Table 4). However, they are among the most optimistic ones when compared to the other models (Table 4). Fur- thermore, Bruni et al. (2021) showed that the level of the predicted C input was much higher under increased soil temperatures. Riggers et al. (2021) used a multi-model ensemble to predict SOC stock increase scenarios under future climate change in German croplands. They esti- mated an average increase of C input of 213–283% to reach an average 4‰ increase between 2090 and 2099, compared to 2014. Our results seem to be in the middle of the range of existing estimates (i.e., a median increase of 118.7% according to the calibrated ensemble), which refers to the period 1980–2010 under the current climate. Indeed, although the estimate of Riggers et al. (2021) is higher than ours, they estimated this change over a lon- ger period (and under future changes in climate), when SOC stocks in German croplands are expected to decrease at a strong rate because of forecasted increased tempera- tures (Riggers et al., 2021; Wiesmeier et al., 2016). Our findings show that the use of one single model to predict the evolution of SOC stocks and its related vari- ables (e.g., the C input) is likely to bias the outputs of the modelling exercise. The present study raises the attention of the soil modelling community to the importance and utility of multi-model simulations and model intercom- parison exercises. Multi-modelling approaches are espe- cially necessary when models are used at new sites without previous validation. Besides, multi-modelling has been an established practice in climate projections for decades (Jebeile & Crucifix, 2020; Parker, 2010; Tebaldi & Knutti, 2007), one example being the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP), which was cre- ated in 1995 and is nowadays the reference framework in which climate models are aggregated to predict future scenarios of climate change (Jebeile & Crucifix, 2020). These ensembles are currently used in the Intergovern- mental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports, consid- ered to be the most reliable source of knowledge about climate change. As for the feasibility of a 118.7% increase in C input, this likely depends on the reference practice against which it is compared. In fact, minerally fertilised crops might already have higher C input compared to unferti- lised crops, due to higher nutrient availability that enhances net primary production (Gross & Glaser, 2021), making it harder to increase C input further. Doubling the C input where mineral fertilisers and EOM inputs are 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

This is the case for Europe, for example, where croplands are usually minerally ferti- lised (Eurostat, 2021) and where EOM inputs are already widely applied (Bruni et al., 2022; Foged et al., 2011; Soussana et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2017). Our results show much lower C input requirements relative to the 10-time increase stated by Berthelin et al. (2022) to reach the 4‰. We argue that all the models used in our exercise do take into account that fresh C inputs have a fast min- eralization rate in the short-term, hence it is unlikely that they are underestimating the C input requirements for this reason (Angers et al., 2022; Berthelin et al., 2022). However, our results may be over-optimistic since we did not account future climate change (e.g., Bruni et al., 2021; Riggers et al., 2021) and because of the uncer- tainty brought by initialization issues, especially on the actual amount of stable SOC. Also, additional C input needs to be maintained once the SOC stocks reach a new equilibrium, that is, several decades to several hundred years (Berthelin et al., 2022). This requires transitioning to practices that permanently provide additional C input to the soil (e.g., agroforestry systems, cover cropping, and improved crop rotations) in order to maintain the goal in the long-term. In addition to that, soils that currently have higher SOC stocks are likely to require more C input to sustain a 4‰ target, compared to soils with depleted SOC stocks (Figure S1), due to the proportional contribution of SOC that is required. This is especially true for soils that are undergoing C losses (e.g., see SOC stock changes in the control plots, Table A2), since the SOC stocks first need to be restabilised before they might increase (Bruni et al., 2022; Soussana et al., 2019). Strate- gies to increase SOC stocks may take into account past and current SOC trends to set the targets, although for soils with high SOC losses this might result in zero net C gains (Bruni et al., 2022; Soussana et al., 2019). In any case, restoring degraded soils should be the priority in order to reach the objective of land degradation neutral- ity (LDN) of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) (Soussana et al., 2019), and C farming strategies should aim to preserve SOC-rich soils while restoring depleting stocks. The database that was gathered for our exercise, shows that increasing SOC stocks with additional EOM is possible for soils that are undergoing SOC losses, in the middle to long-term (i.e., 8 to 54 years) (Table A2). However, it is worth noting that the use of EOM does not result in additional C sequestra- tion but rather in locally increased SOC stocks. For exam- ple, extracting peats from former peatlands in order to apply them to crops is not itself a climate-relevant C sequestration practices because it only moves C from one place to another, with also possible losses. In our work, EOM treatments were used for methodological investiga- tion purposes only. That to evaluate the multi- modelling tool with available agricultural LTEs where SOC stocks were measured after increasing C inputs to the soil. However, we did not quantify the full C cost of acquiring and applying EOM. is, | Variability between calibrated 4.4 models The LME model showed that the models significantly affected the prediction of C input to reach the 4‰ target. That is, the prediction of each model was significantly dif- ferent from the others (Table 5). Furthermore, there was a significant effect of the calibration (Table 5). Although the ensembles' prediction of additional C input was highly var- iable in both configurations (Figure 4), some models' out- puts were correlated to each other once calibrated to fit the stocks (e.g., AMG and ICBM in Figure 5, as opposed to Figure S2). Many factors could be responsible for the crea- tion of such clusters. First of all, similarities in the mathe- matical structure of the models, such as the number of C pools, the linearity of the system of equations, and the type of kinetics reactions. Other computational differences could have introduced this clustering behaviour. For instance, the spin-up method or the number and choice of parameters calibrated. Finally, the inherent representation of soil processes, that is, the different characterisation of pedo-climatic variables in the model functions, also known as structural uncertainty in ensemble modelling (Tebaldi & Knutti, 2007). Disregarding analogies in the mathematical structures of the models and their technical resolution, we investigated the effect of field variables on the variability of model outputs. We found that, while in the non-calibrated configuration MAST, initial SOC stocks and initial C input explained the divergence between model outputs (i.e., their RSD), only water-related vari- ables (i.e., MAP and PET) had a significant linear effect when models were calibrated (Table 6). This means that the calibration realigned the effect of all those variables that were causing models' outputs to diverge, except for MAP and PET variables, whose effects on the RSD were significant after calibration. These results suggest that, after calibration, the high variability across models was mainly due to the representation (or non-representation) of MAP and PET in the models. The models of the ensem- ble do not explicitly represent soil water dynamics, but most of them consider water-related variables as forcing inputs. The version of Century that we used accounts for the effect of water on C decomposition through a 13652389, 2022, 6, Downloaded from https://bsssjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ejss.13330 by Universidad Publica De Navarra, Wiley Online Library on [14/02/2023].

Millennial considers volumetric water content effects on diffusion, matric potential, and oxygen availability, which mainly low molecular weight C affects microbial uptake of (Abramoff et al., 2022). ICBM summarises all environmen- tal (Andrén & Kätterer, 1997), which is calculated using functions that (Fortin depend on soil moisture and temperature et al., 2011; Karlsson et al., 2011). Roth-C and AMG are the only models that explicitly take as input MAP and PET. In AMG, the moisture function depends on MAP and PET and affects the decomposition of C in the active pool (Clivot et al., 2019). In Roth-C, monthly precipitation and PET are used to calculate a topsoil moisture deficit rate modifying factor, which affects all four dynamic C pools (Coleman & Jenkinson, 1996). MIMICS does not explicitly (Wieder et al., 2015). Our finding suggests that particular attention should be given to the representation of water-related vari- ables (e.g., soil moisture, precipitation and potential evapo- transpiration) in soils, to better constrain the underlying processes to diverge (Martinez- Moyano & Richardson, 2013). Models' uncertainty around the effect of water on the SOC cycle is particularly critical in the context of climate change, where extreme events connected to precipitation are expected to increase (IPCC, 2021). Moyano et al. (2012), for instance, showed a strong effect of soil texture and SOM content on the sensitivity of C decomposition to water conditions. Our findings suggest that SOC models are likely to sense differently the effect of climate change on SOC stocks and that the uncertainty among models will be even larger when future changes in precipitation are considered. Vice versa, the uncertainty in soils' response to precipitation is likely to affect future cli- mate change projections. This underlines the importance of multi-model ensembles, both to account for and to potentially reduce the uncertainty among SOC model predictions. cause models variables that Despite the effect of water-related processes on predic- tions, the simulated C inputs were correlated to each other in models with similar structures (Figure 5). In particular, models with simpler structures like AMG and ICBM seemed to behave similarly when calibrated, while models with a higher number of pools clustered together (Figure 5). It is likely that the way models account for C inputs (e.g., their decomposition coefficients, their parti- tioning within different litter pools, and the number of lit- ter pools itself) also affected the variability among models' outputs and created the “structural clusters” of Figure 5 (e.g., similar litter pool partitioning between Century and If models are correctly parametrised and MIMICS). simulate well the evolution of SOC stocks with time, we would expect them to converge regardless of their different mechanistic structures. However, our results suggest that the choice of the mathematical formalism and processes represented in the models significantly affects the predic- tions. This is particularly true for inverse modelling predic- tions of C input changes, where supplementary choices on the litter pool optimization have to be made. | C O N C L U S I O N We found that the calibrated multi-model ensemble was able to correctly reproduce SOC stock changes at the 16 long-term European cropland experiments. We estimated that annual C input will have to increase by 119% (MMM) compared to the unamended controls to reach a 4‰ objective over the experimental sites. Although still very 30 years at high, we observed that the uncertainty among the different models was reduced when parameters were calibrated. The uncertainty among calibrated models was explained by MAP and PET variables, indicating that the divergence in model estimations of additional C input depended on the choice of the processes represented in the models. We suggest that the soil modelling community should rely on multi-model ensembles to account for such uncertainty, and that model representation of water effects on SOC stocks should be further constrained in order to improve model predictions. This is particularly important since uncertainties on the effect of water avail- ability on SOC stocks will likely affect climate change projections, due to future changes in the water cycle. funding A U T H O R C O N T R I B U T I O N S Elisa Bruni: Conceptualization; writing – original draft; methodology; formal analysis.
