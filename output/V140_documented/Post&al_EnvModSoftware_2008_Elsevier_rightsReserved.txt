Box 60 12 03, 14412 Potsdam, Germany Received 25 July 2006; received in revised form 19 March 2007; accepted 6 May 2007 Available online 3 July 2007 Abstract The use of integrated soil organic matter (SOM) models to assess SOM dynamics under climate change, land use change and different land management practices require a quantiﬁcation of uncertainties and key sensitive factors related to the respective modelling framework. Most uncertainty studies hereby focus on model parameter uncertainty, neglecting other sources like input data derived uncertainties, and spatial and temporal properties of uncertainty. Sources of uncertainties assessed in this study stem from uncertainties in model parameterisation and from uncertainties in model input data (climate, soil data, and land management assumptions). Thereby, Monte Carlo based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using a latin hypercube stratiﬁed sampling technique was applied to derive plot scale (focusing on temporal propaga- tion) and river basin scale propagation of uncertainty for long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. The model used is the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which has been extended by a process-based multi-compartment model for SOM turnover. Results obtained by this study can be transferred and used in other simulation models of this kind. Uncertainties resulting from all input factors used (model parameters þ model input data) show a coefﬁcient of variation between 5.1 and 6.7% and accounted for (cid:2) 0.065 to (cid:2) 0.3% soil carbon content (0.06e0.15 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1). Parameter derived uncertainty contributed most to overall uncertainty. Concerning input data contributions, uncertainties stemming from soil and climate input data variations are striking. At the river basin scale, cropland and forest eco- systems, loess and gleyic soils possess the highest degree of uncertainty. Quantiﬁed magnitudes of uncertainty stemming from the examined sources vary temporally and spatially due to speciﬁc natural settings (e.g. climate, land use and soil properties) and deliver useful information for interpreting simulation results on long-term soil organic carbon dynamics under environmental change. Derived from this analysis, key sen- sitive model parameters and interactions between them were identiﬁed: the mineralization rate coefﬁcient, the carbon use efﬁciency parameter (synthesis coefﬁcient) along with parameters determining the soil temperature inﬂuence on SOM turnover (mainly Q10 value) and the soil input related data (soil bulk density and initial soil C content) introduced the highest degree of model uncertainty. The here gained information can be transferred to other process-based SOM turnover models to consider stronger most crucial parameters introducing highest uncertainty contribu- tion to soil C storage assessment under changing environmental conditions.

Soil organic matter is an important soil component as it inﬂuences soil structure and aggregation, soil moisture conditions, soil nutrient status and soil biota, and hence inﬂu- ences ecosystem functioning (Lal, 2004). Due to the complex interactions of processes affecting SOM dynamics, the use of integrated dynamic ecosystem models is seen as a useful tool to assess SOM dynamics. J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 Dynamic modelling is an effective approach to characterise the system by integrating various processes, and as a tool for mechanism understanding, estimating, predicting, and policy making (Zhang et al., 2002). In the context of model simulations, the quantiﬁcation of attached modelling uncertainties on model outputs and infor- mation on how the uncertainty in the model output can be ap- portioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input (sensitivity analysis) are meanwhile necessary information (Hattermann et al., 2005; Janssen et al., 1994; Saltelli et al., 2000a,b; Za¨hle et al., 2005). Recently, a number of studies have been carried out to quantify the uncertainties in simula- tion models and their propagation in the model. Thereby most studies focus on model parameter uncertainties and on the calculation of which parameters contribute most to this un- certainty (Janssen et al., 1994; Saltelli et al., 2004). Parameter uncertainty stems mainly from errors in the measurements used for parameterisation, the method used to scale point mea- surements to the scale the model operates or from parameter and input data estimation of semi-empirical process descrip- tions (e.g. not readily measurable parameters, soil parameters derived from standard soil measurements, Za¨hle et al., 2005). Besides parameter uncertainties, uncertainties related to input data (e.g. soil, land use, climate input data, land management practices) and scaling issues also have to be considered. The aims of the paper is to give a quantiﬁcation of model un- certainties stemming from different sources as well as model parameter and input variables sensitivities using the integrated process-based eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model, Krysanova et al., 1998), which was recently extended to assess SOM dynamics (Post et al., 2004, 2007a,b). Thereby the maximum contribution of these sources to model uncertainty is disclosed. This information is necessary to better interpret SOM model results related to in- vestigation of climate change and land use change (change in land cover and land management practices) impacts in the con- text of soil carbon sequestration and soil fertility issues. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. The Soil and Water Integrated ModeldSWIM SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model, Krysanova et al., 1998) is a con- tinuous-time, spatially distributed model. SWIM works on a daily time step and integrates hydrology, vegetation, erosion and nutrients at the river basin scale. The spatial aggregation units are sub-basins, which are delineated from digital elevation data. The sub-basins are further disaggregated into so called hydrotopes, hydrologically homogenous areas. The hydrotopes are de- ﬁned by uniform combinations of sub-basin, land use and soil type (Krysanova et al., 2000). The model is connected to meteorological, land use, soil and ag- ricultural management data. Detailed process descriptions, validation studies and data requirements can be found in published literature (Hattermann et al., 2004, 2005; Krysanova et al., 1998, 2000), and for the SWIM extension on SOM turnover processes (see next section) a detailed description can be found in Post et al. (2007a,b). 2.2. Model extension for SOM turnover exists into the soil by addition of organic material through accumulating litter, dead ﬁne roots and organic fertilizer, and on the other hand there is a with- drawal from the soil of water and nitrogen by the vegetation, release of CO2 into the atmosphere and export of inorganic nitrogen by soil water ﬂows (e.g. leaching into the groundwater and lateral ﬂow processes). To describe the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) budget organic matter is dif- ferentiated into Active Organic Matter (AOM) as soil organic matter pool and Primary Organic Matter (POM) as litter pool. The latter is separated into ﬁve fractions for each vegetation and crop type (stems, twigs and branches, foliage, coarse roots and ﬁne roots). For all pools of active and primary organic matter the carbon and nitrogen content is considered. The carbon and nitrogen turnover into different stages (pools) is imple- mented as a ﬁrst order reaction (Chertov et al., 1997; Parton et al., 1987) and can be described as multi-compartment process-based concept of soil or- ganic matter turnover. The processes are controlled by matter speciﬁc reaction coefﬁcients. Heterotrophic (substrate induced) soil respiration is calculated through the decay of CPOM and CAOM pools per day. Effects of soil tempera- ture, soil water content and soil pH status on mineralisation and nitriﬁcation are considered through reduction functions (Kartschall et al., 1990). 2.3. Quantiﬁcation of uncertainty and sensitivity Quantifying the variability and magnitude of model output due to incom- plete knowledge of real world processes described in model simulations (Un- certainty Analysis, UA, Janssen et al., 1994) and the apportion of this uncertainty to different sources in the models (Sensitivity Analysis, SA, Salt- elli et al., 2004) is more and more becoming an integral component for inte- grated environmental assessment studies. The method employed here uses Monte Carlo analysis (Rubinstein, 1981), whereas other methods like analytical (e.g. variance propagation, Morgan and Henrion, 1990) or numerical methods can be used as well (e.g. differential uncer- tainty analysis, Worley, 1987; non probabilistic methods like fuzzy sets; possi- bility theory, Ferson and Kuhn, 1992; ﬁrst-order analysis employing Taylor expansion, Scavia et al., 1981; or screening designs, Scott et al., 2000). These methods are mostly referred to local SA, and are used for studying the error prop- agation of models with simple equations or linear models (Scott et al., 2000). Screening designs might be appropriate to isolate the most important factors from a large number that may affect a particular model response. Typical screen- ing designs are ‘‘one-at-a-time’’ experiments. Here the impact of changing the value of each factor is evaluated in turn (e.g. Scott et al., 2000). But local approaches do not account for any interactions between inputs, if they exist (Muleta and Nicklow, 2005). Therefore a Monte Carlo based approach was chosen. Monte Carlo analysis uses multiple evaluations with randomly selected model input and considers the entire range of input factors and possible inter- actions of them in respect to model output. A Monte Carlo analysis typically consists of the following steps (Saltelli et al., 2000a,b): (1) deﬁnition of model variables (input factors) Xi used for the analysis, (2) selection of ranges and the Probability Distribution Functions (PDF) for each Xi, (3) generation of sam- ples within the PDFs (sampling), (4) evaluation of the model output for each element of the input factor sample, (5) uncertainty analysis and (6) sen- sitivity analysis. For the assessment of sensitivity and uncertainty the software tool Simlab (Version 2.2, Saltelli et al., 2004; Tarantola, 2001) developed by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) in Ispra (Italy) has been used. 2.3.1. Deﬁnition of model variables and selection of Distribution Functions the Probability In this study we focus on model parameters and input factors related to the soil organic matter turnover module. SA and UA of hydrological processes us- ing SWIM have been conducted in a recent study (Hattermann et al., 2005) also using Monte Carlo based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Alongside all model parameters driving the model extension for SOM turnover, sensitivity for input data such as climate data (temperature, precipi- tation and global radiation), soil data (initial soil organic carbon content, bulk density and clay content), and agricultural management practices (fertilisation and crop harvest surplus management) is assessed. The coupled carbon and nitrogen turnover module is based on the tight relationship between soil and vegetation processes. On the one hand an input A crucial and fuzzy aspect in SA is the assignment of Probability Distribution Functions (PDFs) for each input factor (Muleta and Nicklow, J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 2005; Xu et al., 2005). In most cases there is an absence of information about ranges and distributions for the input factors. Input factor PDFs were derived through literature review and based on an expert inquiry carried out during two workshops at Aberdeen University, UK (COST 627 meetings, results of expert inquiry can be found at http:// www.abdn.ac.uk/modelling/cost627/Questionnaire.htm, as of 18/03/2007). There, modellers and experimental scientists provided their estimates on input factor ranges and probability distributions. Factors ranges have been narrowed for plot scale assessments, as input factors can be better constrained at the plot scale through the incorporation of more detailed site information (Table 1). For example ﬁeld soil respiration measurements in the study area suggest a Q10 value (Q10 is the value by which the respiration rate differs for a temperature interval of 10 (cid:4)C) in a range 1.8 to 2.2. Furthermore, we relied on simple dis- tributions like Gaussian Normal, Triangular or Uniform distributions as they seem to be sufﬁcient for explorative SA studies (Haan et al., 1998; Helton, 1993). This kind of best guess of PDFs may introduce additional uncertainty, but since the estimation of parameters in ecological studies is mainly done in laboratories or at the ﬁeld scale and then scaled up to landscape or global level, an exact estimation of PDFs (through e.g. formal statistical procedures) is not feasible. Table 1 gives an overview of the input factors PDFs. 2.3.2. Sampling In MC analysis different sampling techniques exists (random sampling, stratiﬁed sampling, quasi-random sampling). Details on the ﬁrst two can be found in McKay et al. (1979) and on the third in Sobol (1990). Since Monte Carlo analysis is computationally expensive, an appropriate sampling method may reduce computational time. In our case we adopted Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS, McKay et al., 1979). Hereby the range of each input factor is divided into N intervals of equal marginal probability (1/N ), and one observation of each input factor Description of input factors (parameters, climate and soil input data and variations in agricultural management practices) used in the sensitivity and uncertainty assessment Description Type Distribution of PDF Range (reference value) References Input factor khum khum_r knit ksyn_ag ksyn_ bg kopm_ag kopm_bg frc_ag frc_bg cnr_ag cnr_bg Q10 topt wsat temp. precip. radiation fertinorg Turnover coefﬁcient of active organic matter [d(cid:3)1] ﬁrst soil layer (humus layer): khum, layers 2,.,n (mineral layers): khum_r Nitriﬁcation coefﬁcient [d(cid:3)1] Synthesis coefﬁcient of primary organic matter [d(cid:3)1], ‘‘carbon use efﬁciency parameter’’ Turnover coefﬁcient of primary organic matter [d(cid:3)1] Allocation of below and above-ground residuals Carbon/Nitrogen ratio Q10 value of soil temp. reduction function Optimal temp. for mineralization, part of soil temp. reduction function [(cid:4)C] Limit of saturated water content, part of soil water reduction function [Vol.%] Temperature [(cid:4)C] Precipitation [mm] Global radiation [MJ/m2] Inorganic fertilisation [kg/ha] fertorg Organic fertilisation [kg/ha] harv_surp Crop harvest surplus [kg/ha] dens clay initsoc Bulk density [%] Clay content [%] Initial soil carbon content [%] ag, above-ground; bg, below-ground.

J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 is made in each interval (Saltelli et al., 2000a,b). This method yields to a re- duced amount of samples to be drawn out of the PDF (in comparison to ran- dom sampling) and guarantees randomness in sampling the full range of the PDF (fully stratiﬁed). This method allows the consideration of correlation dependencies in input factors/input distributions. In our case the plant residual allocation parameters (frc_ag and frc_bg, Table 1) PDFs are negatively correlated (frc_ag ¼ (cid:3)frc_bg) to ensure that the amount subtracted due to e.g. the above-ground fractionation is added with the same amount from the below-ground fraction. The fourth step in MC analysis is to evaluate each input factor creating a sequence of results. This can be done simply through scatter plots or cobweb diagrams to get a ﬁrst impression on single input sensitivity to model results. 2.3.3. Uncertainty analysis Uncertainty is assessed by the quantiﬁcation of model outputs and the use of basic statistics like minima, maxima values, percentiles, expected value (mean), median and variance. Additionally the quantiﬁcation of model outputs can be compared to measurements as reference data. In our case we considered the long-term development of total soil C. Fur- thermore we assessed the uncertainty at the plot scale at a certain time and the temporal course and on the spatial scale (river basin). Besides the overall un- certainty including all model parameters and input data (later referred to as ‘‘all factors’’), an assessment for uncertainty of model parameters (‘‘parame- ters’’), soil input data (‘‘soil’’, including initial soil carbon content, bulk den- sity and clay content), climate input data (‘‘climate’’, including temperature, precipitation and global radiation) and agricultural management practices (fer- tilisation, crop harvest surplus) has been carried out to apportion the overall uncertainty to the different sources (Table 1). For the uncertainty assessment the coefﬁcient of variation (deviation of a variable from its mean, ‘‘standard error’’, COV in %) was calculated accord- ing to eq. (1) to quantify the uncertainty to the mean value and to make a com- parison between the different sources of possible uncertainty, with n ¼ number of simulation runs, x ¼ mean value of output, xi ¼ output value, sd ¼ standard deviation: COV½%(cid:5) ¼ n (cid:3) 1 n X kðx (cid:3) xiÞk (cid:6) i¼1 x ¼ sd (cid:6) x ð1Þ 2.3.4. Sensitivity analysis To identify the relative importance of a particular input factor to the total model output uncertainty, different indices are proposed in literature. They can be grouped in correlation based (Partial Correlation Coefﬁcients (PCC), Pear- son product moment correlation coefﬁcient (PEAR), Spearman coefﬁcient (SPEA)) indices, regression based (Standardised Regression Coefﬁcients (SRC)) index, variance based indices (Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (FAST), Sobol0 sensitivity indices) or their rank transformations (Helton, 1993; Saltelli, 1999; Saltelli and Sobol, 1995). These indices are used to screen model input factors based on the absolute value of the regression, variance or correlation coefﬁcients. For a discussion on sensitivity indices one should refer to Helton (1993), Saltelli and Sobol (1995) and Saltelli et al. (2000a,b). In our case, we adopted the PCC, because it provides a measure of variable impor- tance that tends to exclude the effects of other variables. Additional correlation based methods offer the possibility to include input factors interdependencies. In the calculation of PCC ﬁrst the correlation rxjy is calculated between the input variable Xj (input factor) and the output Y. The output variable Y and the input variable Xj are then assessed from the use of a sequence of linear regres- sion models (Saltelli et al., 2000a,b) to calculate the PCC (with: bY ¼ estimated value of the output value Y and bXj ¼ estimated value of the particular param- eter (j) obtained from the regression model; b0, c0, bh, ch are regression coef- ﬁcients; j and h are respective input factors). bY ¼ b0 þ X hsj bhxh and bXj ¼ c0 þ X hsj chxh ð2Þ The PCC is deﬁned as the correlation coefﬁcient between the terms Xje bXjand Ye bYwhere Xj and Y are a particular parameter and output variable, respec- tively. bXj and bY are the estimated values of the linear regression. As linear regression and correlation based sensitivity indices are impracti- cal for nonlinear models (poor linear ﬁt to non-linear model output), the use of rank transformations can overcome this problem (Saltelli and Sobol, 1995). Thereby the original input and output variables are replaced by their respective ranks. Although it has to be proved that the model behaviour is monotonic (e.g. higher Xj leading to higher Y ). If the coefﬁcient of determination R2 y (de- termines the fraction of variance of the model output explained by the linear regression method used) of the ranked transformed data is higher than of the R2 y of PCC, the Partial Rank Correlation Coefﬁcients (PRCC) can be used. If the PCC values are much smaller/different than PRCC (the absolute values) a non-linear sensitivity of the model to that speciﬁc parameter is present (Saltelli and Sobol, 1995). Model outputs considered were the total soil carbon content (Ctot) and heterotrophic soil respiration (Cresp) for the respective areas under study (Table 2). Total soil carbon (Ctot) is referred to organic compounds only, not including inorganic content (carbonate). For plot scale assessment the Ctot and Cresp values for the last simulation year were used. The same applied to the spatial scale assessment, but here the averaged values for the Nuthe river basin were taken. 2.4. Data sets and study area for uncertainty analysis For the plot scale assessment of uncertainty and sensitivity the ﬁeld exper- imental sites Mu¨ncheberg (long-term ﬁeld experiment V140) and Bad Lauch- sta¨dt (static fertiliser experiment) have been used. Main characteristics and detailed descriptions of these sites can be found in (Franko et al., 2007; Ko¨rschens and Mu¨ller, 1996) for the Bad Lauchsta¨dt site and (Mirschel et al., 2007; Rogasik and Schroetter, 1999; Rogasik et al., 2004) for the Mu¨n- cheberg site and are shown in Table 2. For the spatial assessment of uncertainty the Nuthe river basin was chosen as a test case. The Nuthe river basin is located in Brandenburg, Germany, south of Berlin (Fig. 1). It covers an area of approximately 1900 km2. Mean annual precipitation is 590 mm and mean annual air temperature is 9 (cid:4)C. Land use is dominated by cropland (43% of total area), grassland (13%) and forest (36%). The main agricultural area is in the southern region of the basin with mainly Luvic Arenosols on loess sediments (Fig. 1). Soils are mainly characterized by sandy to loamy soil texture (Cambic Arenosols, Podzols and Gleyic podzols) developed on glacial sediments. 3. Results and discussion 3.1. Factors sensitivity and importance The PCC (partial Correlation Coefﬁcient) was used in this 2 on the raw values study as sensitivity index because the Ry were higher than on the rank transformed PCC values, indicat- ing that the model behaviour in not non-linear. Factors are ranked according to their absolute values of PCC (jPCCj). Through interpretation of correlation plots between each of the input factors and the respective model output (Ctot and Cresp) a threshold of jPCCj ¼ 0.20 could be identiﬁed. Input factors below this threshold do not show any notable impact to model output and are excluded from interpretation. In general it can be stated that the model parameters de- scribing the mineralisation dynamics of SOM (khum), the car- bon use efﬁciency (synthesis parameter, ksyn) and the temperature on parameter regulating the inﬂuence of soil SOM (Q10), can be identiﬁed as most important factors (high jPCCj values, Table 3). The synthesis coefﬁcients of primary organic matter (ksy- n_ag, ksyn_bg) determines the amount of primary organic mat- ter carbon which is stored in the active organic matter pool with J.

A higher value of ksyn consequently increases storage in the ac- tive organic matter pool and reduces heterotrophic soil respira- tion. The high sensitivity index shows the importance in determining this parameter. khum and khum_r in turn deter- mine the mineralization rate and hence the turnover speed of ac- tive organic matter. The mineralization rate for humus layers (khum) and for the mineral layers (khumr) is of similar high im- portance. Higher mineralization rates (and hence higher khum and khum_r values) quicker decrease active organic carbon in soils and increase soil respiration rates. Alongside with these, the parameters regulating the inﬂuence of soil temperature on SOM turnover (Q10, topt) are of high im- portance. The Q10 value shows high sensitivity at all sites with jPCCj values ranging between 0.99 and 0.46 (Table 3). Soil tem- perature effect on SOM turnover is described according to the Stanford approach (Stanford et al., 1973; Stanford and Smith, 1972). Higher Q10 and topt values decrease the value of the re- duction function, which in turn reduce the reaction coefﬁcients (khum, khum_r and kopm) governing the SOM turnover. Conse- quently, for this case, the turnover of SOM is reduced. The pos- itive sign of the PCC values (Table 3) for Q10 and topt for Ctot shows, that an increase of these two parameters leads to a relative increase of soil carbon and a decrease of soil respiration (Cresp, negative PCC values, Table 3). This highlights the strong inﬂu- ence of soil temperature on soil decomposition and mineraliza- tion and of its driving variables Q10 and topt. Also noteworthy are the high importance of the soil factors initial soil carbon content (init_soc) and bulk density (dens). Obviously init_soc determines the level of soil organic carbon trends and an accurate assessment is central in this approach. Bulk density (dens) is a key factor in determining the soil wilt- ing point and ﬁeld capacity and is used in the calculation of soil temperature. In the model, higher bulk densities in soils increase soils wilting point and reduce soils ﬁeld capacity J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 data (land use, Dollinger and Strobl, 1996). leading to higher soil water contents and a reduction of SOM turnover. Higher bulk densities increase the damping factor of soil temperature calculation (Krysanova et al., 2000). This ef- fect tends to smooth and reduce soil temperature dynamics and may reduce turnover of SOM. About eight factors (Q10, khum/k_humr, topt, ksyn_ag/ ksyn_bg, init_soc, dens, Table 3) show overriding inﬂuence on the simulation of soil carbon and soil respiration dynamics. This is to some extent due to the transient model simulation, because of changing environmental conditions and a system which is not in equilibrium (e.g. croplands are at present not in equilibrium because of crop harvest exportation). Especially for SOM degraded agricultural soils (due to land management practices, e.g. intensive cropping), parameters determining the carbon use efﬁciency and the mineralization of SOM show higher inﬂuence as this would be the case for equilibrium condi- tions. Under equilibrium conditions, the parameters driving bio- mass growth would dominate SOM turnover to a greater extend Sensitivity of input factors based on Partial Correlation Coefﬁcient (PCC) calculated for soil carbon content (Ctot, 0e20 cm soil depth) at the end of the respective simulation period (Bad Lauchsta¨dt and Mu¨ncheberg experimental site, see Table 2), spatial averaged at the end of the simulation period (Nuthe river basin, see yearly sum for the Nuthe river basin Rank Ctot Bad Lauchsta¨dt Ctot Mu¨ncheberg Ctot Nuthe river Cresp Bad Lauchsta¨dt Cresp Mu¨ncheberg Cresp Nuthe river Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.99) Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.82) Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.96) Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.98) Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.62) Factor PCC (R2 ¼ 0.96) Q10 init_soc khum topt temp ksyn_ag ksyn_bg frc_bg 0.938 0.926 (cid:3)0.914 0.776 (cid:3)0.340 0.299 0.298 (cid:3)0.253 init_soc Q10 khum ksyn_bg dens topt ksyn_ag glob temp harv_surp fertorg 0.762 0.653 (cid:3)0.620 0.585 (cid:3)0.538 0.406 0.400 0.334 (cid:3)0.282 0.221 0.200 khum Q10 ksyn_bg temp topt init_soc dens ksyn_ag fertorg harv_surp glob precip frc_bg (cid:3)0.989 0.986 0.971 (cid:3)0.963 0.962 0.935 (cid:3)0.912 0.885 0.880 0.866 0.835 0.505 (cid:3)0.353 khumr Q10 dens topt init_soc khum temp harv_surp precip kopm_bg glob clay fertorg ksyn_bg frc_bg frc_ag¼frc_bg 0.982 (cid:3)0.960 0.945 (cid:3)0.884 0.869 0.742 0.697 0.640 0.604 (cid:3)0.601 (cid:3)0.502 0.447 0.383 (cid:3)0.293 0.269 ksyn_ag Q10 khum topt harv_surp dens khumr temp glob (cid:3)0.592 (cid:3)0.462 0.394 (cid:3)0.337 0.291 0.283 0.250 0.222 0.204 (cid:3)0.953 Q10 0.929 khumr (cid:3)0.812 topt 0.453 khum 0.306 init_soc 0.284 dens ksyn_bg (cid:3)0.236 Abbreviations of input factors are explained in Table 1.

The same holds for parameters determining soil temperature effect on SOM turnover constants (Q10 and topt). 3.2. Assessment of uncertainty Following the concept described for the sensitivity and un- certainty assessment, we assess the uncertainty in model re- sults due to model parameters, agricultural management practices, soil input data and climate input data and a combina- tion of all mentioned input factors. Additionally it was distin- guished between the inherent uncertainty at the plot scale and at the spatial (river basin) scale. Furthermore a quantiﬁcation of land use and soil related uncertainty distribution is assessed. 3.2.1. Plot scale assessment The evolving of uncertainty with time at the plot scale is demonstrated for a 51 years time series at Bad Lauchsta¨dt and for a 37 years time series at Mu¨ncheberg ﬁeld experimen- tal site for long-term trends of soil organic carbon content. Uncertainty stemming from variations of model parameters shows the highest effect on soil organic carbon trends at both sites (Figs. 2 and 3b) with a range of 0.55% Corg ((cid:2)0.275% Corg, (cid:2)0.13 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 Bad Lauchsta¨dt) and 0.11% Corg ((cid:2)0.055% Corg, 0.05 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 Mu¨ncheberg, Table 4) at the end of the simulation period. Overall uncertainty intro- duced when considering variations of all input factors is for the Bad Lauchsta¨dt site 0.63% Corg ((cid:2)0.315% Corg, (cid:2)0.15 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1) and 0.13% Corg ((cid:2)0.065% Corg, (cid:2)0.06 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1) for the Mu¨ncheberg site (Table 4). The sources soil and climate are contributing less to the over- all uncertainty in model output, whereas variations in crop har- vest surplus and fertilisation show the least effects (Fig. 3cef). Soil and climate input variations lead to 0.17% to 0.2% Corg for Bad Lauchsta¨dt and 0.07% to 0.03% Corg for Mu¨ncheberg site (Table 4). The agricultural management (variations in fertilisa- tion and harvest surplus) contributions to uncertainty are quan- tiﬁed between 0.09% Corg and 0.01% Corg for Bad Lauchsta¨dt and Mu¨ncheberg respectively (Table 4). Besides the dominating contribution of parameter uncer- tainty, variations in soil and climate inputs are also of consid- erable importance. The effect of variations in climate on soil carbon contents is increasing with time showing the long- term and delayed inﬂuence of climatic variations for SOC dynamics. In contrast, soil input data variations (initial SOC content, bulk density and clay content) contribution to uncer- tainty with time remains the same (Mu¨ncheberg) or decreases (Bad Lauchsta¨dt). The tendency of the long-term trend based on all simulation runs of the uncertainty study is in agreement with the long-term trend in measurements for the Bad Lauchsta¨dt site, whereas the Mu¨ncheberg site shows a slight increasing trend of all simula- tion runs when compared to the measurements. For the Bad Lauchsta¨dt case it has to be noted, that the measurements rep- resent 2 t ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 organic dry matter farmyard manure and no organic fertilisation (Fig. 3a), whereas the simulation was conducted with 1.2 t ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 organic fertilisation to ensure (a) and Cresp (b) and all cases (Bad Lauchsta¨dt, Mu¨ncheberg and Nuthe river basin). same fertilisation schemes for both sites. Nevertheless it can be stated that variations in measurement are of similar magni- tude than variations in overall model uncertainty. Furthermore the absolute range of uncertainty is lower for the Mu¨ncheberg case possessing low soil organic carbon con- tent which is independent from the different simulation times. This suggests that poor soils (with generally low soil organic matter contents) are less sensitive to variations in model pa- rameter than soils with high fertility (generally featuring high soil organic matter contents). In turn changing environ- mental conditions (e.g. changing climate) introduces higher absolute changes for soil with higher soil organic carbon con- tents. This is in line with recent ﬁndings of (Bellamy et al., 2005), where it was found for topsoils in England and Wales that losses in SOC due to changing environmental conditions are proportional to soil organic carbon contents (e.g. losses are higher for soils with higher organic carbon). 3.2.2. Spatial scale assessment For comparison of the variability between the different sources of uncertainty the coefﬁcient of variation (COV%, see equation 1) was used. It has to be mentioned that land cover classes like urban areas, industry, water bodies and peat soils (soil organic carbon contents greater than 20%) have been excluded here, which explains the value 0% COV. tively considering (a) all factors, (b) parameters, (c) soil, (d) climate, (e) crop harvest management (harv_surp) and (f) fertilisation.

Please note that for Bad Lauchsta¨dt no measurement were conducted for the fertilisation scheme used in this study (1.2 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1, various amount of NPK, see Table 2) and measurements representing 2 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 (black circles) and no organic fertilisation (black rhombic sign) are shown.

COV [%] ranges for the uncertainty assessment of all input factors is between 4.26% and 6.74% COV, for parameters be- tween 2.06% and 6.37% COV, followed by soil (2.5e4.76%), climate (0.33e2.5%), harvest surplus (0.14e0.45%) and fertil- isation (0.14e0.39%, Table 5). This introduces a maximal un- certainty of (cid:2)2.9 t C ha(cid:3)1, 0.18 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 for the basin and all factors (mean organic C content in the basin is 43 t C ha(cid:3)1, ﬁrst 30 cm in soil). As for the point scale assessment of uncertainty, parameter variations introduce the largest degree of uncertainty. The contribution of input related uncertainty shows the same ranking as for the plot scale assessment, al- though the magnitude of soil input variations is stronger at the spatial scale with higher COV values (Table 5). The same can also be stated for climate input variations, but there it is less pronounced. In terms of mean COV values (Fig. 5), soil in- put derived uncertainty (mainly through init_soc, see Section 3.1) is even higher than the parameter contribution. The pattern of the spatial uncertainty distribution regarding the investigated sources is similar with clearly distinguishable areas of high and lower uncertainty (Fig. 4aef). Especially the southern region of the Nuthe river basin shows high values of COV. There are also some spots with high COV values located in the northern and central part of the basin. In these areas, Luvic Arenosols developed on loess deposits and croplands with Cambisols are dominating (see Fig. 1).

Slightly different is the ranking for parameter variations with forest and croplands showing similar COV values. Variations in climate, however, are leading to higher COV values in forest ecosystems. Looking at soil type contribution to uncertainty in terms of COV values, it can be recognised that Gleyic soils (Gleyic Luvi- sol and Gleysol) and Luvic Arenosol (loess sediments) possess highest COV values both considering all factors and the differ- ent sources (parameters, soil, climate, crop harvest surplus and fertilisation, Fig. 5b). Uncertainty in simulating river discharge and river basin water balance using SWIM was found to be high- est in loess regions when compared to other landscapes in the German part of the Elbe river basin (Nuthe river basin is a sub- catchment of the Elbe river basin, Hattermann et al., 2005). Soil physical properties of loess soils (driving the soil water dynam- ics) are difﬁcult to characterise as loess soils possess an inherent high variability of soil physical properties like available ﬁeld ca- pacity or soil porosity (Post et al., 2007a,b). These uncertainties stemming from soil properties (and consequently soil tempera- ture and soil water dynamics) are considerably impacting long- term SOC dynamics. Also notable is the highest mean COV value for Gleysol soils in terms of climatic variations. Soils inﬂuenced by high water contents and typically higher soil organic carbon contents deliver the highest degree of uncer- tainty. Here variations of input factors show the highest impacts on soil carbon contents. Parameter variations (especially Q10 and topt, see Section 3.1) and climate variations change the tem- perature sensitivity of SOM turnover and deliver higher variabil- ity in long-term SOC dynamics. Parameter variations and variations in soil input data are the clearly dominating sources of uncertainty related to soil types and broad land cover contributions (Fig. 5a and b). Soils with high soil carbon content (Gleyic soils and Luvic Arenosol on loess sediments) show higher rates of increase or decrease in SOC when soil data (mainly initial SOC content and bulk den- sity, see Section 3.1) and parameters (mainly khum and ksyn, see Section 3.1) are increased or decreased. As noted for the J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 (b) parameters, (c) soil, (d) climate, (e) crop harvest management (harv_surp) and (f) fertilisation. plot scale assessment, soils with higher clay contents are more sensitive to variations in model parameter and input data (soil and climate). The results based on soil types and broad land cover classes are however interrelated with each other, because fertile soils are associated with croplands and less productive soils are associated with forest or grassland. Nevertheless the assessment results in a detection of sensitive sources both in the model system and in spatial pattern of soils and land cover types for the study area. 3.3. Implications for long-term soil organic carbon dynamics The quantiﬁed uncertainty provides useful information to in- terpret simulation experiments and to assess for example land management impacts on long-term SOC dynamics. For exam- ple, crop types and rotational systems impact long-term SOC dynamics (Freibauer et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2000). Besides other studies, crop rotation impacts on long-term SOC contents J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 term soil organic carbon dynamics (Post et al., 2007a,b) for the Mu¨ncheberg site considering the original rotation (see Table 2) and a lay arable use (2 years grain crops and 4 years grass) under unfertilised conditions. scales lead to different characteristics of uncertainty magni- tudes and that a temporally and spatially quantiﬁcation of model parameters and input data derived uncertainty is necessary. Soils with high SOC content (as the Bad Lauchsta¨dt soil with high SOM content and loess substrate) and croplands are more sensitive towards variations in model parameters and model in- put data and feature highest changes in soil carbon dynamics. For croplands, management practices additionally alter the SOC dynamics and variations in these contribute to the higher uncertainty. Soil and climate induced uncertainty is consider- able and is more pronounced at the river basin scale. Here the effects of climate and soil condition variations are more effec- tive than at the plot scale, with maximal COV values of 4.76 and 2.5 at the river basin scale compared to 3.4 and 1.7 at the plot scale respectively (Table 5). For croplands impacts of manage- ment practices show stronger effects at the plot scale with higher maximal COV values (0.3% for the river basin and 0.7 to 0.26 at the plot scale, Table 5, Fig. 4a). The absolute contributions of the uncertainty ranges (ex- pressed here with COV values) however are dependent on the correct assignment of the parameter distribution function deﬁnition (PDF, see Section 2.3.1). Especially for agricultural management practices the distribution or variation in e.g. ap- plication of fertiliser or harvest surplus management might be higher, probably leading to higher COV values. Therefore absolute COV values have to be interpreted regarding the cho- sen PDF. But relative contributions of the sources assessed here provide relevant information. 4. Conclusion The assessment reveals that model parameters describing the mineralisation rate of soil organic matter, the carbon use efﬁciency parameter (synthesis parameter) and the Q10 value describing the inﬂuence of soil temperature on SOM dynamics introduce the highest degree of uncertainty and are the most important factors. This is an important ﬁnding transferable to other SOM models of this kind. Nuthe river basin expressed by zonal mean values and standard variations (black lines) of coefﬁcient of variation (COV in %, see eq. 1) considering (1) all factors, (2) parameters, (3) soil, (4) climate, (5) crop harvest manage- ment (harv_surp) and (6) fertilisation. are estimated around (cid:3)0.078 to þ0.36 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 in Norway (Singh and Lal, 2005) and (cid:3)0.13 to þ0.1 t C ha(cid:3)1 yr(cid:3)1 for the study area (Post et al., 2007b) using the described modelling tool. As noted by Freibauer et al. (2004) and Smith (2004) the related uncertainty of crop rotation impact is very high but was not quantiﬁed. Relating here the quantiﬁed uncertainty contribution stemming from model parameters to crop rotation impacts on long-term SOC dynamics shows that uncertainties are considerable but do not interfere with simulated long-term trends of crop rotation impacts on SOC dynamics (Fig. 6). It has to be mentioned that parameter derived uncertainty, as esti- mated here, still is rather an overestimation, as for example the synthesis coefﬁcient (ksyn, see Table 1) is used with a bulk range for all plant types present in the model’s data base and not concerning the ranges for the plant types present in the crop rotation only. This implies that the model structure is ca- pable of representing crop rotation impacts under the quantiﬁed uncertainty. The example shows that the presented study allows specifying the uncertainty ranges in which (in this case) crop ro- tational impacts alter long-term SOC dynamics. Combining plot and spatial scale results for uncertainty stemming from all factors and the examined sources alone shows that the magnitudes are temporally and spatially differ- ent. This implies that different natural settings and different J. Post et al. / Environmental Modelling & Software 23 (2008) 125e138 sensitivities temperature The high importance of the Q10 value is especially relevant for climate change impact studies. But changes in Q10 under changing climatic conditions in spatial and temporal domains is currently not properly resolved (Fang et al., 2005; Hyvonen et al., 2005; Reichstein et al., 2005b) and needs further re- search efforts. Additionally a scientiﬁc consensus about differ- ent temperature sensitivity on SOM turnover rate constants in a process model) of e.g. labile and slow soil C pools or organic and mineral soil C pool is not yet achieved (Fang et al., 2005; Giardina and Ryan, 2000; Hyvonen et al., 2005; Reichstein et al., 2005a). Soil temperature sensitivity (Q10 dependency) is pivotal in as- sessing SOM dynamics in our assessment, which is also sup- ported by other ecosystem studies (Joos et al., 2001), laboratory and ﬁeld experiments (Fang et al., 2005; Knorr et al., 2005; Reichstein et al., 2005b). (in terms of The rate of soil organic matter mineralisation has to be de- termined using long-term ﬁeld experimental sites under differ- ent land use and soil conditions or using laboratory incubation experiment. Incubation experiments are also used to derive the carbon use efﬁciency parameter (synthesis parameter). Espe- cially the changing properties of these parameters under changing environmental conditions (climate change, land use change) are not sufﬁciently resolved yet. Considering the re- sults presented, constraining these parameters, through e.g. benchmarking sites, is important. This underlines the rele- vance of soil mapping and long-term soil surveys for regional impact studies and the importance of dynamic assessment of soil temperature, soil water and soil nutrient processes to sim- ulate SOM turnover. The identiﬁcation of most important input factors can also be transferred to other model of this kind, as these parameters are central also for other process-based SOM models (Bergmann et al., 1999; Lettau and Kuzyakov, 1999). Besides the parameter contribution to uncertainty, which dominate both at plot and river basin scale, in particular soil input data and less pronounced climate input data are impor- tant, especially at the river basin scale. Here mainly initial SOC content, bulk density and air temperature are important factors. For the river basin scale assessment, Gleysol and Luvic Arenosols on loess sediments alongside with croplands could be identiﬁed as areas with highest uncertainty in modelling long-term soil carbon dynamics. This is mainly due to difﬁcul- ties in soil physical properties parameterisation for loess soils and due to the fact that variations in SOC contents are higher for soils with higher level of C content (Bellamy et al., 2005). Variations in agricultural management practices (variations in the fertilisation scheme and in crop harvest surplus manage- ment) are contributing least to overall uncertainty. But espe- cially here, factors probability distribution functions (PDF), which ranges might be estimated too narrow, might lead to an underestimation of uncertainty. The assignment of factors PDF is central in this approach for the assessment of uncertainty, but was performed using maximal ranges and typical distributions found in literature, based on expert enquiries and own estimates. The fact that incomplete knowledge of PDFs were set to a large range, to assess uncertainty when transferring the model to another regional setting, and not properly reﬂecting the knowledge of parameter values and their ranging for the study area, rather leads to an overestima- tion of uncertainty. Model constraining using benchmarking sites and ﬁeld measurements in the study area would consider- ably narrow the presented model uncertainty, but was not the scope of this study as we wanted to disclose sources of uncer- tainty and their possible magnitudes. The uncertainty assessment for the plot and river basin scale discloses the input data and model parameter related sources of uncertainty. The results obtained are transferable to other temperate regions. Magnitudes of uncertainty are de- pendent on land cover and soil properties where variations of model factors lead to different impacts on SOC dynamics both spatially and temporally. This study delivers a spatially and temporally distributed assessment of model parameter and input data uncertainty and importance ranking of the relating factors and provides necessary information to better interpret integrated simulations of long-term soil organic carbon dynamics under changing en- vironmental conditions.
