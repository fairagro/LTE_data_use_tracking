This article is an open access publication Abstract Nitrogen (N) supply from organic amend- ments [such as farmyard manure (FYM), slurries or crop residues] to crops is commonly expressed in the amendment’s Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV). Values for NFRV can be determined by comparison of crop yield or N uptake in amended plots against mineral fertiliser-only plots. NFRV is then deﬁned as the amount of mineral fertiliser N saved when using organic amendment-N (kg/kg), while attaining the same crop yield. Factors known to affect NFRV are crop type cultivated, soil type, manuring time of application. We history and method or investigated whether long-term NFRV depends on N application rates.

Barkusky Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Eberswalder Straße 84, 15374 Muencheberg, Germany experiments in Europe, values of NFRV at low total N supply were compared with values of NFRV at high total N supply. Our ﬁndings show that FYM has a signiﬁcant higher NFRV value at high total N supply than at low total N supply (1.12 vs. 0.53, p = 0.04). For the other amendment types investigated, NFRV was also higher at high total N supply than at low total N supply, but sample sizes were too small or variations too large to detect signiﬁcant differences. Farmers in Europe usually operate at high rates of total N applied. If fertiliser supplements are based on NFRV of the manure estimated at low total N supply, N fertiliser requirements might be overestimated. This might lead to overuse of N, lower N use efﬁciency and larger losses of N to the environment.

Often application of mineral fertilisers is combined with application of organic amendments farmyard manure (FYM), slurries, and crop residues (also called organic manures, organic fertilisers or organic inputs). N in organic amendments generally has a lower availability to crops than N in mineral fertilisers, mainly depend- ing on the C:N ratio of the amendment (Flavel and Murphy 2006). Therefore, N in organic amendments must be carefully matched with mineral fertiliser N application to avoid leaching while making sure sufﬁcient N is available for crop growth. This requires the characterization of the organic amendments by their Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV), also called the Mineral Fertiliser Equivalent (Jensen 2013). NFRV can be based on the amount of mineral fertiliser N which is substituted by an amount of organic amendment-N (kg/kg) while attaining the same crop yield (Herron and Erhart 1965; Schro¨der 2005a; Schilling 1987). Crop yields can be expressed as fresh matter weights (FM), dry matter weights (DM) or N contents (N yields, Jensen 2013). These are all valid procedures, with the difference that values of NFRV based on N yields are often slightly lower than those based on DM or FM weights (Jensen 2013). N in organic amendments is always accompanied by other nutrients, such as phosphorus (P), potassium (K) or sulphur (S) which also affect crop yields. It is therefore important to exclude these effects when estimating values of NFRV based on yields (either DM, FM or N yields, Schro¨der 2005a). Lory et al. (1995) have suggested to calculate NFRV using economic optimal N rates (mineral fertiliser N application rates at which marginal crop yields offset marginal fertiliser costs) with and without organic amendments. Yields at economic N rates with and without organic amendments might however differ, which hampers comparison at equal yield levels. In addition, economic N rates are dependent on prices of fertilisers and harvested products, which makes estimations less robust through time and space. Another manner to determine NFRV of organic amendments is by using isotope dilution techniques. Using 15N labelled materials, the fate of N from either organic amendments or mineral fertilisers is measured among plant and soil fractions and compared (Diek- mann et al. 1993; Janzen et al. 1990). Additional methods to calculate NFRV (such as the analysis of near infrared reﬂectance spectra of organic amend- ments) have been proposed but need further develop- ment (Delin et al. 2012). Values for NFRV differ when estimated in the ﬁrst year of application of organic amendments (short-term NFRV) or after repeated applications and several years (long-term NFRV, Gutser et al. 2005; Schro¨der 2005b), with higher values found for long-term NFRV. For FYM, NFRV ranges between 0.10 and 0.70 (Birkmose 2009; Jensen 2013; Pikula et al. 2016; Webb et al. 2013). For slurry, NFRV ranges between 0.20 and 0.90 (Birkmose 2009; Delin et al. 2012; Jensen 2013; Kundler et al. 1989; Langmeier et al. 2002; Webb et al. 2013). For straw, NFRV has been estimated to be around zero (Dhillon and Dev (1984) as cited by Katyal 1993). For green manures, NFRV has been estimated ca. 0.4 (Janzen et al. 1990), but this will probably depend on the species of green manure cultivated. Factors known to affect NFRV (at a given dose of the amendment) include the form of N in the amendment, crop type cultivated, soil type, method of application, time of application and the manuring history which may govern N retention and losses (Birkmose 2009; Jensen 2013; Katyal 1993; Kundler et al. 1989; Webb et al. 2013). Here we evaluate the effect of an additional factor on NFRV which is currently not taken into account: the total N supply. We address the following research question: Does NFRV of organic amendments depend on total N supply? Materials and methods To answer the research question, values for long-term NFRV were calculated based on yield response curves Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst (2018) 110:105–115 (either DM or FM weights of marketable products) at low and high total N supply. This required data from ﬁeld trials where different N rates were applied with and without organic amendments. In such a set-up, mineral fertiliser N saved with an addition of organic amendment at low mineral fertiliser rates (Nsaved low) can be compared with mineral fertiliser N saved by adding the same amount of organic amendment at high mineral fertiliser rates (Nsaved high). In these cases, sufﬁcient P and K has to be applied to ensure these macro-nutrients are not a yield limiting factor and affect the calculation of NFRV of organic amend- ments. Organic amendments however do not only supply N, P and K but also other nutrients, such as sulphur (S). Over the past decades, S was often not yield limiting due to the ample supply from the atmosphere (Eriksen 2009). More recently this has in ﬁeld changed but not always adjusted for experiments. In a recent meta-analysis of long term experiments in Europe (Hijbeek et al. 2017), a database was compiled with data from 20 long term experiments. All these 20 experiments fulﬁlled the following six criteria: (1) at least four increasing levels of mineral fertiliser N rates without organic amendments; (2) at least four increasing mineral fertiliser N rates with organic amendments; (3) P and K applied in ample amounts on all ﬁelds; (4) at least ﬁve years of yield data; (5) if crops are cultivated in rotation, yield data available for at least two rotation cycles; (6) yield data reported for individual crop types (no aggregated data of whole-rotation yield output were used). Assessing NFRV called for an additional requirement particular to this study: (7) N contents of organic amendments must be known. Using these seven criteria, we assembled a total of 38 data sets (with multiple crops and organic amend- ment types) from eight experiments in ﬁve countries across Europe (Table 1). The experiments ranged in duration between 15 and 44 years. These data, there- long-term NFRV, fore, can be used to consider including the greater part of the residual effect of manure application (Herna´ndez et al. 2013; Jensen 2013; Schro¨der these 2005b).

We therefore use the term ‘total N supply’. For each data set, two yield response curves to mineral fertiliser-N were ﬁtted, one without (Y0) and one with organic amendments (YA), following George (1984), see Fig. 1.

For each pair of curves, the amount of mineral fertiliser saved by using an organic amendment was calculated at low and high total N supply (Nsaved low and Nsaved high).

Accordingly, N0 max was deﬁned as the mineral fertiliser N rate needed to reach Y 0;A max without organic amendments. Following, Nsaved high is the c without FYM.

If so, this was included in the calculation of Nsaved low and Nsaved high.

Statistical models based on the function lme (linear mixed-effects model) of package nlme (Pin- heiro et al. 2015) were used to ﬁnd the least squares (LS) means for NFRVlow and NFRVhigh per type of organic amendment. These models can account for random effects (Konstantopoulos 2011). In this anal- ysis, the eight experiments were included as random effects. All data were processed in R (version 3.2.5; R Core Team 2015). Results Nsaved low and Nsaved high for FYM were calculated for seventeen pairs of response curves (Fig. 2). Mean NFRVlow of FYM was 0.53 (±0.26–95% Conﬁdence Interval (CI)) and mean NFRVhigh of FYM was 1.12 (±0.71–95% CI) (n = 17, Table 2). NFRVhigh was 2.13 times larger than NFRVlow (p = 0.04, Table 2). For slurry, only one dataset was available (Fig. 3). For this dataset, NFRVlow was 0.35 and NFRVhigh was 0.58. The ratio between NFRVhigh and NFRVlow was 1.65 (n = 1, Table 2). For straw, one-third of the NFRV values was negative at low total N supply, while almost half (47%) of the NFRV values for straw was negative at high total N supply (n = 15, Fig. 4). Mean NFRVlow for straw was 0.12 (±0.36–95% CI) and mean NFRVhigh was 0.35 (±1.67–95% CI). NFRVhigh for straw was 3.07 times larger than mean NFRVlow, but not signiﬁcantly so due to the large variation in the effects of straw on mineral fertiliser requirements (p = 0.79). In ﬁve data sets, a combination of straw and green residues (green manures and/or beet leaves) was used as an organic amendment (Fig. 5). In all ﬁve cases, additional mineral fertiliser N was added to support decomposition of straw and/or cultivation of green manures, which was accounted for. At low total N supply, combining straw and green residues had a negative NFRV in two cases.

Blue arrows pointing to the left indicate saving of mineral fertiliser N when applying slurry at low and high total N supply. (Color ﬁgure online) negative NFRV did not occur for a combination of straw and green residues in our dataset. Mean NFRVlow was 0.14 (±0.39–95% CI) and mean NFRVhigh was 0.91 (±1.21–95% CI). For the combi- nation of straw and green residues, NFRVhigh was 6.6 times larger than NFRVlow, but not signiﬁcantly different, due to the small sample size (Table 2). Discussion For all types of organic amendments, mean NFRV was higher at high total N supply than at low total N supply. Only for FYM the difference was signiﬁcant (p = 0.04). For the other types of organic amendment either the sample sizes were too small or the variation too large for detecting signiﬁcant differences. Currently, values for NFRV are often estimated by applying organic amendments without extra mineral fertilisers. In Europe, farmers often apply a mixture of organic amendments and mineral fertilisers, thus having a higher total N supply (Potter et al. 2010). We compared values for NFRV at high total N supply (either the highest yield within the experimental set-up or the maximum of a response curve) with values of NFRV for organic amendments at low total N supply (at the start of the response curves). In practice, farmers will (1) operate within environmental restric- tions on N applications and (2) try to achieve an economic optimum. Therefore, most often farmers will target yields somewhat below the yield maximum of the N response curves, which will generally be closer to the values we calculated for NFRVhigh than for NFRVlow. Crop residues are often not used by farmers to replace mineral fertilisers as they have a high C:N ratio and might require N for decomposition (Knapp et al. 1983). In these cases, crop residues have a negative NFRV. Straw had a negative NFRV in one- third (NFRVlow) to half (NFRVhigh) of the cases in our study. A combination of green manures and straw had a negative NFRV in two-ﬁfth (NFRVlow) to none (NFRVhigh) of the cases. Our ﬁndings are based on 38 datasets from eight long term experiments. Besides straw and FYM, however, there were only a limited number of observations per organic amendment type (Table 2). Further work is needed to assess to what extent NFRV differs between low and high total N supply for the other amendment types, for different soil and climate conditions and in combination with different crop types. Such an exercise would require a much larger dataset, preferably with N contents of organic amend- ments available. A number of mechanisms might change the shape of the yield response curve and therefore cause a difference between the values of NFRVlow and NFRVhigh, on which we will now elaborate. A ﬁrst mechanism could be that organic amendments provide other beneﬁts than N to the crops (other nutrients or soil improvements), which has not been adjusted for in the mineral fertiliser only plots. In this case, the calculated values of NFRV cannot be solely attributed to N but include additional yield effects (Janssen 2002; Wadman et al. 1987). Elimination of the limita- tion(s) that cause such additional yield effect (e.g. by supplying a mineral S fertilizer) would result in a steeper mineral fertilizer response (i.e. a better con- version of applied mineral fertiliser N into DM or FM yield). Consequently, NFRVhigh would decrease and approach NFRVlow. A second alternative explanation is that addition of mineral fertiliser might increase available N from the amendment (or vice versa). Third, addition of mineral fertiliser could increase uptake efﬁciency of N from organic amendment (or vice versa). Finally, a combination of above mecha- nisms might take place at the same time. In our study, savings of mineral fertiliser when using organic amendments were compared at low and high total N supply. At low N supply, using only organic amendments was compared with using only mineral fertiliser. At high total N supply, using a combination of organic amendments and mineral fertiliser was compared with using only mineral fertiliser.

(Color ﬁgure online) amendments is higher when organic inputs are com- bined with mineral fertiliser. This suggestion could be further investigated by calculating NFRV of organic amendments when applied in different amounts. If validated, this would open a new perspective on the advantage of distributing available organic amend- ments among many farmers in a given region: the region would require less fertiliser to produce the same yield output, than when the available organic amend- ments were concentrated in few farms. In this study, we have used yield response curves expressed in either dry or fresh matter to calculate values for NFRVlow and NFRVhigh. Other methods exist to calculate NFRV, such as based on N content (Jensen 2013) or using isotope dilution techniques (Diekmann et al. 1993; Janzen et al. 1990). An exploration of different methods into NFRVlow and NFRVhigh might give further insights into possible mechanisms. the If our ﬁndings can be further generalized, observed contrast in NFRV between the respective N ranges may have practical implications for fertiliser recommendations, depending on the mechanisms underlying the contrast. Similarly, the contrast might justify adjustment of statutory values for fertiliser equivalency coefﬁcients as used to regulate N use in the Action Programmes—under the Nitrates Direc- tive—of various EU member states. Conclusions Currently, values for NFRV are often based on experiments where crop yields in plots with only organic amendments (no mineral fertilisers) are com- pared with crop yields in plots with only mineral fertiliser, at relatively low total N supply. In many European countries, however, farmers operate at high total N supply. NFRV coefﬁcients play a key role in fertiliser recommendation systems and tools (e.g. MANNER-NPK, Nicholson et al. 2013) and various national Action Programmes in response to the EU Nitrates Directive (EEC 1991). For example, current Action Programmes in the UK, Denmark and the Netherlands use NFRV values of 0.10, 0.45 and 0.30–0.60 kg/kg, respectively for total N in FYM, Nutr Cycl Agroecosyst (2018) 110:105–115 and values of 0.45, 0.75 and 0.60–0.80 kg/kg for pig slurry (Dalgaard et al. 2014; RVO 2014; UK 2015).1 These values are often a political compromise, but based on short or long-term estimations of NFRV. These statutory values deﬁne, in combination with N application standards, the maximum amounts of N fertiliser that farmers in those countries may apply, depending on crop and soil type. This meta-analysis of eight long term experiments on different types of organic amendments shows that NFRV of FYM was roughly up to two times larger at high than at low total N supply rate. Currently, NFRV is usually assessed at the ‘lower end’ of the N response curve. Considering that farmers in Europe normally operate at relatively high mineral fertilisation rates, the use of NFRV determined at the ‘lower’ end of the N response curve may underestimate NFRV of organic amendments. When using these lower values to estimate the N fertilizer replacement value of organic amendments, complementary mineral N fertiliser requirements are estimated to be larger than actually needed for achieving certain yields. This might lead to overuse, lower N use efﬁciency and more losses to the environment.
