However, humans directly influence Si cycling on a global scale. Intensified agriculture and corresponding harvest-related Si exports lead to Si losses in agricultural soils. This anthropogenic desilication might be a big challenge for modern agriculture. However, there is still only little knowledge about Si cycling in agricultural systems of the temperate zone, because most studies focus on rice and sugarcane production in (sub)tropical areas. Furthermore, many studies are performed for a short term only, and thus do not provide the opportunity to analyze slow changes in soil–plant systems (e.g., desili- cation) over long periods. We analyzed soil and plant samples from an ongoing long-term field experiment (established 1963) in the temperate zone (NE Germany) to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen-phosphorus- potassium (NPK) fertilization rates and crop straw recycling (i.e., straw incorporation) on anthropogenic desi- lication in the long term. Our results clearly show that crop straw recycling not only prevents anthropogenic desilication (about 43–60% of Si exports can be saved by crop straw recycling in the long term), but also re- plenishes plant available Si stocks of agricultural soil–plant systems. Furthermore, we found that a reduction of N fertilization rates of about 69% is possible without considerable biomass losses. This economy of the need for N fertilizers potentially can be combined with the benefits of crop straw recycling, i.e., enhancement of carbon sequestration via straw inputs and prevention of anthropogenic desilication of agricultural soil–plant systems. Thus crop straw recycling might have the potential to act as key management practice in sustainable, low fertilization agriculture in the temperate zone in the future. 1. Introduction Various favorable effects of silicon (Si) on plants have been reported, i.e., increased plant growth and resistance against abiotic (e.g., drought) and biotic (e.g., fungal infections) stresses (e.g., (Epstein, 1999; Ma, 2004; Puppe and Sommer, 2018). Against this background, the Inter- national Plant Nutrition Institute (IPNI) categorizes Si as a ‘beneficial substance’ for plants (www.ipni.net). Aside from plants numerous or- ganisms are evolutionary adapted to use monomeric silicic acid (H4SiO4) for the synthesis of hydrated amorphous silica (SiO2⋅nH2O) in a process called biosilicification (Ehrlich et al., 2010; Perry and Keeling- Tucker, 2000). In soils biogenic silica (BSi) formed by bacteria, fungi, protists (mainly diatoms and testate amoebae), animals (mainly sponges), and plants can be found representing bacterial, fungal, pro- tistic, zoogenic, and phytogenic BSi pools, respectively (Puppe, 2020). BSi pools, especially the phytogenic ones, play an important role as source of readily or plant available Si (i.e., H4SiO4) in soils, because amorphous BSi is much more soluble compared to crystalline SiO2 and silicates (Schaller et al., 2021). Si availability in turn is of special importance for agricultural biogeosystems considering the beneficial effects of Si for many crops (Haynes, 2014, 2017). Synthesized siliceous structures in plants are called phytoliths, which are mainly made of SiO2⋅nH2O, but also contain organic matter and various elements, e.g., aluminum, calcium, iron (Fe), manganese, phosphorus (P), and potas- sium (Buj´an, 2013; Kameník et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2014). Phytoliths are formed in living plants within cells (i.e., in the cell wall and the cell * Corresponding author. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.geoderma.2021.115187 Received 21 January 2021; Received in revised form 26 April 2021; Accepted 29 April 2021 Geoderma403(2021)115187Availableonline9May20210016-7061/©2021ElsevierB.V.Allrightsreserved.D. Puppe et al. lumen) and have a specific morphology that can be used for taxonomic identification of plants (Hodson, 2016; Piperno, 2006; Sangster et al., 2001). However, next to durable (i.e., relatively stable) phytoliths, that can be frequently found in most soils, Si depositions in plants can be found in intercellular spaces or in an extracellular (cuticular) layer forming very fragile silica structures (Hodson, 2016; Sangster et al., 2001). These fragile silica structures might represent the biggest and most reactive BSi pool in soils, and thus might be the most important drivers of bio-available Si in terrestrial biogeosystems (Puppe et al., 2017). Si concentrations of plants vary considerably with about 0.1–10% Si per dry mass depending on plant species (Hodson et al., 2005). Based on their Si concentration per dry mass plants have been divided into three groups (Ma and Takahashi, 2002): (i) Non-accumulators or excluders (Si concentration per dry mass < 0.5%), (ii) Intermediate accumulators (Si concentration per dry mass 0.5–1%), and (iii) Accumulators (Si concentration per dry mass > 1%). Regarding field crops especially cereal grasses of the family Poaceae (or Gramineae) are known as Si accumulators (Hodson et al., 2005). However, it should be kept in mind that the mechanisms behind the uptake, transport, and accumulation of Si in plants (active vs. passive Si transport) as well as Si induced plant resistance (mode of action of Si in plants) are not fully understood yet, and thus are under controversial discussion (see, e.g., (Coskun et al., 2018; Exley, 2015; Exley et al., 2020). Although the majority (>90 vol%) of the earth crust consists of SiO2 and silicates, plant available Si is often limited in soils because Si is (i) competing with P, nitrogen (N), and carbon (C) for sorption sites at organic matter and mineral surfaces (Reithmaier et al., 2017; Schaller et al., 2019) and (ii) leached as a function of rainfall and irrigation, especially in agricultural soils (Haynes, 2019). Plant available Si in soils is ultimately controlled by the weathering stage of a soil, whereby the importance of phytoliths for plant available Si in soils has been found to increase with increasing weathering stage (Li et al., 2020). In general, soils poor in plant available Si can be characterized as highly weathered, leached, acidic, and low in base saturation. Such conditions are typical for many soils in (sub)tropical regions, where two well-known Si accu- mulators are grown, i.e., rice (0ryza sativa) and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) (see (Datnoff et al., 2001 and references therein). For the determination of plant available Si, several extraction methods (e.g., calcium chloride, acetate/acetic acid, or citrate extractions) have been developed (see the review of (Sauer et al., 2006). Regarding agricultural soils especially the influence of (i) adsorption/desorption reactions, (ii) leaching of Si from soils, (iii) BSi pools, and (iv) soil pH on the plant available Si fraction need a deeper understanding in general (Haynes, 2014). Due to intensified land use (forestry, agriculture) humans directly influence Si cycling on a global scale (Struyf et al., 2010; Vandevenne et al., 2015a, 2015b). In this context, especially Si exports by harvested crops (most of them are Si accumulators) and increased erosion rates generally lead to a Si loss in agricultural soils (anthropogenic desilica- tion, see, e.g., (Desplanques et al., 2006; Guntzer et al., 2012; Keller et al., 2012; Vandevenne et al., 2012). Besides climate change, a growing global population, and decreasing resources (e.g., (Amundson et al., 2015; Vitousek et al., 2009; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013), anthropogenic desilication might be one of the big challenges for modern agriculture. In fact, harvesting of field crops, for example, (cid:0) 1 per year depending on causes a Si loss of up to 100–500 kg Si ha cultured crops (Meunier et al., 2008; Tubana et al., 2016). On a global scale about 35% of total phytogenic BSi is synthesized by field crops due to their relatively high Si concentrations as well as biomass and this proportion is going to increase with increased agricultural production within the next decades (Carey and Fulweiler, 2016). In order to avoid (natural) limitations of plant available Si and enhance plant growth and resistance against abiotic and biotic stresses, Si fertilization is widely used (Puppe and Sommer, 2018; Savant et al., 1999; Tubana et al., 2016). Additionally, Si fertilization might also be an effective method to mitigate anthropogenic desilication. In this context, specific Si fertilization, for example, in the form of BSi recycling (incorporation of organic siliceous materials like straw, husk, and husk ash) might be a promising and cost effective strategy for both decreasing desilication and enhancing Si supply for crops to increase yields (e.g., (Haynes, 2017; Marxen et al., 2016; Meena et al., 2014). Moreover, the use of Si-rich biochar (Li et al., 2019; Li and Delvaux, 2019) and open straw burning in the field (Nguyen and Nguyen, 2019) have been pro- posed as suitable ways to supply agricultural soil–plant systems with Si. However, most studies on Si fertilization or supply focus on rice and sugarcane production in (sub)tropical areas and there is still only little knowledge about Si cycling in agricultural systems of the temperate zone. Furthermore, many studies are performed for a short term only (e. g., one cropping season), and thus do not provide the opportunity to analyze slow changes in soil properties (e.g., plant available Si) caused by management practices. In this context, long-term field experiments (LTFEs) represent important tools for investigating changes in soil properties under different management practices and corresponding impacts on crop production and sustainability over long periods. The results obtained from LTFEs are of great importance to understand the trends and dy- namics of these changes, and thus are indispensable for researchers as well as policymakers (e.g., (Debreczeni and K¨orschens, 2003; Sand´en et al., 2018). Regarding Si cycling in agricultural soil–plant systems, there have only few results from LTFEs been published until now. For example, (Guntzer et al., 2012) found the long-term removal of wheat straw to decrease the soil amorphous silica pool in soils at Rothamsted Research. (Yang et al., 2020) analyzed the long-term (36 years) influ- ence of phytolith-rich straw recycling and groundwater table manage- ment on labile Si soil fractions and Si uptake by rice in subtropical China. These authors found total labile Si concentrations to increase signifi- cantly with increasing phytolith-rich straw application, whereby the largest Si fraction in soils was represented by amorphous Si assumed to originate mainly from plants (phytoliths). However, there are no studies on long-term straw recycling and its effects on Si cycling in soil–plant systems of the temperate zone to the best of our knowledge. In our study we analyzed soil and plant samples from an ongoing LTFE (established 1963 in a randomized block design: plots of low, medium, and high mineral nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilization rates, plots with crop straw recycling in addition to NPK fertilization, control plots) in NE Germany to answer the following questions: (i) Can we observe a significant desilication (indicated by a decrease in plant available Si in soils) of agricultural systems in the temperate zone in the long term? (ii) Is this potential desilication affected by NPK fertilization rates? (iii) Is this potential decrease of plant available Si in soils reflected in Si concentrations of the grown plants (e.g., wheat as Si accumulator)? (iv) Can we prevent potential anthropogenic desilication by crop straw recycling? The answers to these questions will help us to obtain a deeper un- derstanding of Si cycling in agricultural biogeosystems in the temperate zone and to assess the potential of Si for a more environmentally friendly and sustainable production of resilient crops. This kind of production is intended, for example, by the “Farm to Fork Strategy”, an important component of the European Green Deal, which aims to overcome climate change and environmental degradation (Commission, 2019).

Study site and sampling ◦ 31’01’’N, 14 ◦ The examined LTFE “V140” (52 07’19’’E) at ZALF was established in a full randomized block design in 1963 to analyze the effects of different mineral and organic fertilizers on yields and soil fertility (Barkusky, 2009; Barkusky et al., 2020). The experimental site is managed according to “Good Agricultural Practice”. The soil is classified as Albic Luvisol (Arenic, Neocambic) (World reference base for soil re- sources, 2014) with argic horizons in depths of 80–120 cm (Bt1) and 120–160 cm (Bt2), soil texture is dominated by sand (Table A1). The climate is characterized by a mean annual precipitation of 555 mm and a ◦ C (ZALF weather station, 1981–2010). mean annual temperature of 8.9 The experimental setup includes different treatments, i.e., (i) NPK fertilization in steps of five rates related to N (plots NPK 1–5), (ii) organic fertilization (manure or straw plots), and (iii) control plots, with 8 field repetitions per treatment (168 single plots in total, see Fig. 1). Aboveground plant biomass (yield) per plot is captured every year. For (cid:0) 1 y-1 depending our study we selected plots of low (NPK 1, 0–50 kg N ha (cid:0) 1 y-1), on crops, resulting in a mean fertilization rate of about 30 kg N ha (cid:0) 1 y-1, mean fertilization rate of about medium (NPK 3, 40–150 kg N ha (cid:0) 1 y-1, mean 98 kg N ha (cid:0) 1 y-1) mineral NPK fertilization fertilization rate of about 166 kg N ha rates. Additionally, plots with crop straw recycling (incorporation of 4.0 (cid:0) 1 every second year generally using chopped straw t dry mass (DM) ha of the harvested cereal crop, Table 1) in addition to NPK fertilization (NPK 1 + Straw, NPK 3 + Straw, NPK 5 + Straw), and control plots (no NPK fertilization, no crop straw recycling) in 4 field repetitions per treatment were analyzed (Fig. 1). Soil samples were regularly taken by the staff of the Experimental Station of ZALF and analyzed (e.g., pH, phosphate concentrations) in the Central Laboratory of ZALF (Barkusky, (cid:0) 1 y-1), and high (NPK 5, 80–250 kg N ha 2009; Barkusky et al., 2020) (Fig. A1). We used retained soil samples from 1976 (i.e., samples taken 13 years after the beginning of the experiment) and 1998 (i.e., samples taken 35 years after the beginning of the experiment) and additionally took soil samples in 2018 (i.e., 55 years after the beginning of the experiment) for our analyses (see 2.2.). In addition, samples of winter wheat (2018) were analyzed to detect potential effects on Si concentrations in Si accumulating crops (see 2.2. as well). 2.2. Soil and plant analyses Soil samples were air dried and sieved and the fine earth fraction (<2 mm) was used for laboratory analyses. Soil pH was measured based on the (DIN ISO, 1039) in 0.01 M CaCl2 suspensions at a soil-to-solution ratio of 1:5 (w/v) after a 60 min equilibration period using a glass electrode. Calcium chloride (CaCl2) was used to extract the easily sol- uble or mobile Si fraction, i.e., the plant available Si fraction (Si present in the soil solution, i.e., silicic acid (H4SiO4) in most soils). For extrac- tion, two-gram samples of soils were placed in 50 mL plastic centrifuge tubes with 20 mL of a 0.01 M CaCl2 solution. Samples were agitated continuously on a reciprocating shaker for 16 h (Haysom and Chapman, 1975; de Lima Rodrigues et al., 2003). All soil analyses were performed at the minimum of two lab replicates per sample. ◦ Phytoliths were extracted from soil samples as follows: (i) 10 g of dry soil material (<2 mm) was weighed, (ii) organic matter was oxidized using H2O2 (30%), HNO3 (65%), and HClO4 (70%) at 80 C until reac- tion subsides, (iii) carbonates and Fe oxides were dissolved by boiling the sample in HCl (10%) for 30 min, (iv) the < 2 μm granulometric fraction was removed by dispersion of the remaining solid phase with a sodium hexametaphosphate solution (2%, 6–12 h), (v) samples were centrifuged (1,000 rpm, 2–3 min) and decanted, (vi) phytoliths were separated by shaking with 30 mL of sodium polytungstate (cid:0) 3 and subsequent (Na6(H2W12O40)⋅H2O) with a density of 2.3 g cm centrifugation (3,000 rpm, 10 min), (vii) the supernatant was carefully pipetted and filtered using 5 μm Teflon filters (this step was repeated three times), (viii) the filter residue was washed with distilled water, ◦ C, and weighed. Pureness of the isolated phytoliths bulked, dried at 105 was checked via polarized light microscopy (Nikon ECLIPSE LV100 microscope). Phytolith morphotypes were characterized according to (Madella et al., 2005) and (Neumann et al., 2019). ◦ Plant samples (winter wheat) were washed with distilled water to remove adhering soil minerals and oven-dried at 45 C for 48 h. Sub- sequently, plant samples were separated into straw, grain, and husk for further analyses. The different plant materials were milled using a knife mill (Grindomix GM 200, Retsch) in two steps: (i) 4,000 rpm for 1 min and (ii) 10,000 rpm for 3 min. Sample aliquots of approximately 100 mg were digested under pressure in PFA digestion vessels using a mixture of 4 mL distilled water, 5 mL nitric acid (65%) and 1 mL hydrofluoric acid (40%) at 190 C using a microwave digestion system (Mars 6, CEM). A second digestion step was used to neutralize the hydrofluoric acid with 10 mL of a 4% boric acid solution at 150 C. All plant analyses were performed in three lab replicates per sample. ◦ ◦ Si concentrations in soil and plant extracts were measured via ICP- OES (ICP-iCAP 6300 Duo, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) using internal standards. To avoid Si contaminations, only plastic equipment was used during the entire procedures. 2.3. Calculation of Si inputs and outputs Potential minimal and maximal Si inputs per year were calculated for the corresponding cultivated crop by multiplication of its (i) minimal and (ii) maximal Si concentration (in % each) with the rate of crop straw (cid:0) 1 every second year) (see Table 1). Subsequently, recycling (4.0 t DM ha we calculated cumulative sums for (i) minimal and (ii) maximal Si inputs of the period 1963–2018. Si outputs (i.e., gross Si outputs) per year were calculated by multiplication of the corresponding aboveground biomass Plots used for the current study are highlighted in black (control plots), orange (NPK plots), and purple (NPK + Straw plots). The numbers indicate the NPK fertilization rate: 1 = Low NPK fertilization rate, 3 = Medium NPK fertilization rate, 5 = High NPK fertilization rate. Geoderma403(2021)1151873D. Puppe et al.

Results 3.1. Harvest-related Si outputs at the long-term field experiment V140 Cumulative sums of minimal and maximal annual Si outputs were considerably higher at NPK and NPK + Straw plots compared to control plots (Fig. 2). Under low (NPK1) and medium (NPK3) NPK fertilization Geoderma403(2021)1151874D. Puppe et al. Data for (A) low (NPK1), (B) medium (NPK3), and (C) high (NPK5) fertilization rates are displayed. rates NPK + Straw plots were characterized by slightly higher Si outputs compared to NPK plots. In contrast, Si outputs in the high (NPK5) NPK fertilization treatment were almost equal at NPK and NPK + Straw plots. Si outputs in medium (NPK3) and high (NPK5) NPK fertilization treat- ments were comparable and higher than Si outputs in the low (NPK1) fertilization treatment. An overview of (i) annual Si outputs (ranges and means of min. and max. Si outputs) and (ii) maximal Si outputs per year of individual cereal crops, i.e., maize, barley, wheat, and rye, can be found in the appendix (Table A2, Fig. A2). Cumulative sums of minimal and maximal annual net Si outputs clearly revealed crop straw recycling effects (Fig. 3). Under all NPK fertilization rates (i.e., NPK1, NPK3, and NPK5) NPK + Straw plots were characterized by considerably lower net Si outputs compared to NPK plots. Under low fertilization rates (NPK1) net Si outputs at NPK + Straw plots were even lower than net Si outputs at control plots. Net Si outputs at NPK and NPK + Straw plots in medium (NPK3) and high (NPK5) fertilization rate treatments were comparable and considerably higher than net Si outputs in the low (NPK1) fertilization rate treatment. The difference (Δnet Si output) between cumulative sums of annual net Si outputs of NPK plots and corresponding NPK + Straw plots increased with time (Fig. A3). Calculated deltas (Δnet Si output) represent the po- tential savings on Si outputs by crop straw recycling. At plots under low (cid:0) 1 fertilization rates (NPK1) Δnet Si output reached about 0.2 and 6.2 t ha DM (1963–2018) assuming minimal or maximal Si output, respectively. Under medium fertilization rates (NPK3) Δnet Si output was about 0.1 and (cid:0) 1 DM assuming minimal or maximal Si output, respectively. 5.6 t ha Under high fertilization rates (NPK5) Δnet Si output reached about 0.2 and 6.9 t ha (cid:0) 1 DM assuming minimal or maximal Si output, respectively. 3.2. Si concentrations of plant materials of winter wheat Si concentrations of analyzed plant materials increased in the order (cid:0) 1), and husk (cid:0) 1), straw (6.3–10.7 mg g grain (range: 0.2–0.4 mg g (cid:0) 1) (Fig. 4). Statistically significant differences between (9.5–23.2 mg g the plots were found for straw and husk samples, whereby these dif- ferences were more pronounced in husk samples. This means that dif- ferences between the plots were more pronounced with increasing Si concentrations in plant materials. While Si concentrations of husk samples were highest in control plots, Si concentrations of husk samples tended to decrease with NPK fertilization rate. Si concentrations of husk 1963–2018.

Puppe et al. between the experimental plots were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (n = 4). samples were slightly higher at NPK + Straw plots compared to NPK plots. We found no relationships between Si concentrations of plant materials and plant available Si in soils (see 3.3): grain Si vs. plant available Si (rs = -0.036, p = 0.939), straw Si vs. plant available Si (rs = 0.143, p = 0.760), and husk (rs = 0.429, p = 0.337). 3.3. Plant available Si and phytoliths in soils (cid:0) 1), 1998 (5.9–8.4 mg kg (cid:0) 1, mean: 9.2 mg kg (cid:0) 1, mean: 6.3 mg kg (cid:0) 1), and 2018 (8.3–9.9 mg kg Plant available Si in soils considerably increased with time: 1976 (cid:0) 1, (range: 5.1–7.6 mg kg (cid:0) 1) mean: 7.2 mg kg (Fig. 5). However, statistically significant differences between the treatments (0, NPK, NPK + Straw) were found only in samples of 1976 with highest concentrations of plant available Si in control plots and lowest concentrations in NPK5 + Straw plots. This pattern of decreasing plant available Si concentrations with increasing NPK fertilization rates was also given for samples of 1998 (although statistically not signifi- cant). In contrast, plant available Si in soil samples of 2018 was found to be very similar in the different treatments (0, NPK, NPK + Straw) with a smaller difference between minimal and maximal values (min.: 8.3 mg (cid:0) 1, difference: 1.6) compared to 1998 (min.: 5.9 kg (cid:0) 1, difference: 2.5) and 1976 (min.: 5.1 mg mg kg (cid:0) 1, difference: 2.5). Differences in plant available kg Si in soils between control, NPK, and NPK + Straw plots in a given year were only statistically significant for NPK5 in 1976 (Fig. A4). In general, concentrations of plant available Si in soils tended to decrease with increasing plant biomass (rs = -0.410, p = 0.065). Plant biomass for every single year can be found in the appendix (Fig. A5).

However, this increase also tended (p < 0.1) to be statistically significant for all other treatments (NPK1, NPK1 + Straw, NPK3, and NPK5 plots) except control plots.

Phytolith concentrations and 2018 (1.7–3.4 mg g were higher than ammonium oxalate-soluble Fe concentrations (1 mg (cid:0) 1) in the upper 30 cm of soils (Ap horizon), but lower compared to g (cid:0) 1) in the Ap horizon (Table A1). Due to dithionite-soluble Fe (2.6 mg g relatively high standard deviations there were no distinct differences between phytolith concentrations in soils of NPK and NPK + Straw plots, although there seemed to be a trend to higher phytolith concentrations in NPK + Straw plots compared to NPK plots (i.e., in seven times out of nine, see Fig. 7). Highest phytolith concentrations were unexpectedly (no crop straw recycling, lowest plant biomass) recorded at control plots in 2018. Most phytoliths were classified as elongate, polylobate, short (saddle, rondel), and cross morphotypes, which are typical for grass (Poaceae) phytoliths (Fig. 8A, B). Aside from phytoliths, some diatom frustules and sponge spicule fragments were also observed (Fig. 8B). Plant available Si in soils was strongly related to soil pH and phy- tolith concentrations in soils, and tended (p < 0.1) to be significantly correlated with Nt and PDL (Table 2). 4. Discussion 4.1. Anthropogenic desilication of agricultural systems in the temperate zone in the long term In general, the calculated potential Si outputs in our study showed a (cid:0) 1 per year (calculated wide range with maxima up to about 1,500 kg ha for winter wheat with a Si concentration of 11.3%, cf. Table 1). How- ever, depending on the measured Si concentration in wheat plants (cultured 2018), actual Si outputs at V140 have to be considered smaller than potential maximal values. In fact, Si concentrations in wheat were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (n = 4). Geoderma403(2021)1151876D. Puppe et al. treatment (control plots (0), mineral fertilizer plots (NPK), and mineral fertilizer plots that were additionally supplied with crop straw (NPK + Straw)) were evaluated using the Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA (n = 4). aboveground biomass ranged between 0.4 and 0.8% (mean 0.5%) depending on experimental treatment (control > NPK1 > NPK1 + Straw > NPK3 + Straw > NPK5 + Straw > NPK5 > NPK3), and thus are about four to eight times higher than published minimal Si concentrations of wheat (0.1%, (Hodson et al., 2005). Accordingly, we can reasonably (cid:0) 1 for winter wheat in assume an actual mean Si output of about 66 kg ha the year 2018 at our study site. This value is in the range of previously reported Si uptakes (which can be assumed to equal Si outputs by har- (cid:0) 1 y-1, see vesting) for wheat in the temperate zone (i.e., 20–113 kg Si ha (cid:0) 1 y-1; (Savant et al., 1996) kg Si ha (cid:0) 1 y-1, (Savant et al., 1999), these values are and sugarcane (379 kg Si ha (cid:0) 1 y-1, (Keller et al., 2012) kg Si ha considerably lower. Contrary to natural ecosystems (Si uptake of 2–127 (cid:0) 1 y-1, (Keller et al., 2012), where large amounts of Si are kg Si ha recycled year by year (e.g., (Sommer et al., 2013), the annual Si exports in agricultural soil–plant systems are mostly not compensated. This is clearly underlined by our results: annual net Si outputs were always considerably higher at plots without straw recycling compared to plots with straw recycling. That implies a successful compensation of harvest- related Si exports by crop straw recycling (see subsection 4.4 for a more detailed discussion of this aspect) (Fig. 9). (Guntzer et al., 2012) analyzed archived soil (selected samples from the years 1881–2000) and plant (selected samples from the years 1872–2000) samples of the long-term “Broadbalk winter wheat Geoderma403(2021)1151877D.

However, it has to be kept in mind that Si availability in (agricultural) soils is determined by a complex interaction of factors, and thus liming effects on Si avail- ability follow no general rule, i.e., there are studies showing negative and other studies reporting positive correlations between pH and Si availability (see the review of (Haynes, 2019). In this context, the source (lithogenic/pedogenic, biogenic, adsorbed, or fertilizer Si) of potentially available Si and the evaluation period (weeks, years, or decades) of pH effects are key factors for soil pH-Si availability relationships. 4.2. Effects of NPK fertilization rates on anthropogenic desilication Our results show that NPK fertilization rates control plant biomass, and thus harvest-related Si exports. Cumulative sums of, e.g., maximal Si (cid:0) 1 DM (1963–2018) to 14 and 15 t exports increased from about 10 t ha (cid:0) 1 DM under low (NPK1), medium (NPK3), and high (NPK5) fertil- ha ization rates, respectively. The corresponding potential savings on Si exports by crop straw recycling were relatively high and reached about (cid:0) 1 DM (1963–2018) for low (NPK1) and medium (NPK3) fertil- 6 t ha ization rates. Under high fertilitation rates (NPK5) Δnet Si output was (cid:0) 1 DM. Due to the fact that values of Δnet Si output increase about 7 t ha with time, crop straw recycling becomes the more effective the longer straw recycling is applied. Our study shows that about 43–60% of Si exports can be saved by crop straw recycling in the long term. This is also reflected by increasing phytolith concentrations in soils with time. Said phytoliths were classified as elongate, polylobate, short, and cross morphotypes, which are typical for grass phytoliths (Madella et al., 2005; Neumann et al., 2019), and thus directly can be assigned to the crops cultured at V140. Higher plant biomass generally leads to higher Si exports, which in turn lead to decreasing plant available Si concen- trations in soils with time. NPK + Straw plots often showed higher biomass compared to NPK plots indicating synergistic effects of NPK and Si supply. This is in line with studies on, e.g., rice production, where Si fertilization has been found to increase yields by enhancing N fertil- ization efficacy (Savant et al., 1996). Similarly, (Thomsen and Chris- tensen, 2004) found that long-term (1981–1999) incorporation of barley straw increased yields and total N uptake in winter wheat. These find- ings are corroborated by pot experiments with winter wheat, which indicated an increase in aboveground plant biomass and nitrogen use in soils of V140.

They found that the long-term removal of wheat straw considerably decreased amor- phous silica pools in soils. However, a distinct relationship between this decrease and a corresponding decrease in Si concentrations of crop straw was not observable. In fact, Guntzer and colleagues (2012) found such a relationship only for the samples taken before 1944. After this year Si concentrations in straw tended to increase. From their results (Guntzer et al., 2012) concluded increased soil pH due to periodic liming to in- crease amorphous silica (i.e., phytoliths) dissolution, and thus to represent the main driver of increased Si uptake by the cultivated wheat plants. This is underpinned by a recent study of (Caubet et al., 2020), Geoderma403(2021)1151878D. Puppe et al. Relationships (Spearman’s rank correlation) between selected soil properties and phytoliths.

(Klotzbücher et al., 2020) analyzed the Si mobility in soils depending on sorption competition with highly competitive compounds (i.e., dis- solved organic matter and phosphates). From their results they concluded a weaker binding strength of Si (as compared to P and dis- solved organic matter) to Fe oxides leading to Si mobilization by the input of P and dissolved organic matter. It should be kept in mind that the laboratory experiments of (Klotzbücher et al., 2020) were performed under acidic conditions (pH 4) resulting in a potentially decreased binding strength of Si due to slowed polymerization of H4SiO4 (cf. (Schaller et al., 2020). According to these findings it can be assumed that NPK fertilization as well as organic matter input by crop straw recycling should increase Si mobilization in soils resulting in potentially higher Si accumulation in plant biomass. (Li et al., 2020), for example, found combined Si-P fertilizers to increase concentrations of plant available Si in soils leading to higher biomass and phytolith concentrations of rice plants. However, in our study we found (i) no significant differences between the different experimental plots regarding plant available Si in soils of 2018 and (ii) Si concentrations in plant material (i.e., straw and husk) of winter wheat to be very similar at NPK3, NPK3 + Straw, NPK5, and NPK5 + Straw plots. Thus we found no evidence for a relationship between plant available Si in soils and corresponding Si uptake by plants driven by higher NPK fertilization rates and potential corresponding Si-P interactions in soils in the long term (see also subsections 4.3 and 4.4). However, due to the fact that we solely analyzed plant materials from 2018 such a relationship might manifest in future studies focusing on long-term Si uptake rates of crops under different NPK fertilization rates. As Si-P interactions in the soil–plant system are driven by complex biogeochemical processes that are still not fully understood (e.g., (Schaller et al., 2019), further studies are needed to enlighten this aspect. Generally, the results of (Guntzer et al., 2012) (see subsection 4.1 for details) indicate that Si concentrations in crops tend to increase with increasing Si supply in the long term. In this context, it is of great interest to which degree Si uptake of cultured plants is determined by their phylogenetic position, the mode of Si uptake, and environmental factors like temperature or Si availability (e.g., (Prychid et al., 2004; Hodson et al., 2005; Cooke and Leishman, 2012; Coskun et al., 2018). Taking into account that (i) Si concentrations in analyzed plant materials (i.e., straw and husk) of winter wheat were very similar and (ii) differences in Geoderma403(2021)1151879D. Puppe et al. plant biomass at NPK3, NPK3 + Straw, NPK5 and NPK5 + Straw plots were negligible in our study (Fig. A6), we reasonably can assume Si exports at medium (NPK3, NPK3 + Straw) and high (NPK5, NPK5 + Straw) fertilization rates to be about the same size. However, as we found an increase of plant available Si in soils with time these Si exports at V140 were not only compensated by straw supply, but stocks of plant available Si were also replenished by straw recycling in the long term. Furthermore, the yield (plant biomass) data of V140 show that a reduction of N fertilization rates of about 69% (N rate of NPK1 vs. N rate of NPK3, which is commonly applied as regulated by the national Fer- tilizer Ordinance) is possible without considerable biomass losses (Fig. A7). This economy of the need for N fertilizers can be combined with the benefits of crop straw recycling (NPK1 + Straw), i.e., enhancement of C sequestration via straw inputs (cf. (Barkusky et al., 2020) and prevention of anthropogenic desilication of agricultural soil–plant systems (this study). 4.3. Relationship between Si concentration of wheat and plant available Si in soils (cid:0) 1, (Cornelis et al., 2011) mg kg Concentrations of plant available Si in soils of V140 increased with (cid:0) 1, and 2018: 8.3–9.9 (cid:0) 1, 1998: 5.9–8.4 mg kg time (1976: 5.1–7.6 mg kg (cid:0) 1). While said concentrations in soil samples from 1976 were mg kg comparable to plant available Si in topsoils of agricultural sites in the (cid:0) 1 in the upper 30 cm, (Kaczorek et al., temperate zone (about 5 mg kg 2019), concentrations of plant available Si in soils from 2018 reached values comparable to the low range of plant available Si in soils of un- disturbed ecosystems like forests under temperate conditions (e.g., (cid:0) 1; (Puppe et al., 2015) mg 10–40 mg kg (cid:0) 1; (Kaczorek et al., 2019). It can be assumed that this increase of kg plant available Si in soils is also reflected in corresponding Si concen- trations of crops (cf. (Guntzer et al., 2012). However, this assumption has to remain unproven in our study due to the lack of plant samples from 1976 (as well as 1998). Regarding plant samples from 2018 con- centrations of plant available Si in soils were not correlated to Si con- centrations of wheat parts, i.e., grain, straw, and husk. Such a relationship has been reported in some studies, which considered several study sites with relatively large gradients in plant available Si, conducted in (sub) tropical regions where sugarcane and rice are culti- vated. (Miles et al., 2014), for example, analyzed 28 sites located throughout the sugarcane-growing areas of South Africa and found a close correlation between plant available Si in soils (0.01 M CaCl2 as (cid:0) 1) and extractant, range of plant available Si in soils: about 10–95 mg kg Si concentrations in sugarcane leafs. Regarding rice production (Kornd¨orfer et al., 2001) analyzed 28 field experiments in the Ever- glades Agriculture Area representing a wide range of available Si in soils. They found plant available Si in these soils (0.5 M acetic acid as (cid:0) 1) to be extractant, range of plant available Si in soils: about 5–85 mg L correlated with Si concentrations in rice straw. Our results corroborate studies that did not observe (or only partly found) a relationship between plant available Si in soils and Si con- centrations in plants. For example, (Klotzbücher et al., 2018) found no relationship between plant available Si in soils (herein concentration of dissolved Si in soil solution) and Si concentrations in rice straw in one (i. e., the drier one) of two analyzed cropping seasons in a field experiment in Southern Vietnam. However, they found such a correlation in the second cropping season, i.e., the wetter one. From their results (Klotz- bücher et al., 2018) speculated climatic differences to be responsible for their observation (cf. (de Tombeur et al., 2020) and concluded field experiments to be inconsistent with results from laboratory studies regarding relationships between plant available Si in soils and Si uptake by plants (e.g., (Gocke et al., 2013; Marxen et al., 2016). This is underpinned by (Keeping, 2017), who found that the uptake of Si by sugarcane in a shade house pot experiment did neither reflect the con- centration of plant available Si in soils nor the Si concentration of used Si sources (calcium silicate slag, fused magnesium (thermo) phosphate, volcanic rock dust, magnesium silicate, and granular potassium silicate). In general, the ambiguous results discussed above reveal the complexity of soil–plant Si interactions and as long as we do not better understand the factors that determine plant availability of Si in soils and Si uptake by plants (uptake mechanisms, phylogenetic and environ- mental factors) these interactions remain arcane. According to (Haynes, 2014) there are three key factors that control plant availability of Si: (i) the Si concentration in soil solution, (ii) the reserve in the solid phase as Si source (e.g., amorphous pedogenic and biogenic silicates, crystalline phyllosilicates, residual Si fertilizers), and (iii) the Si adsorption ca- pacity or retention capability of the soil. As all of these factors are the result of complex biogeochemical interactions, and thus differ from one soil to another, a general understanding of plant availability of Si in different soils and its uptake by plants represents a hard-set challenge especially for soil–plant systems in the temperate zone. This is because (younger) soils in the temperate zone are mostly not highly weathered as it is the case for (sub)tropical (older) soils showing a characteristically low Si availability (Sommer et al., 2006), and thus biogeochemical Si cycling might be characterized by more potential interactions between the various Si pools and fractions in soils of the temperate zone. Furthermore, inconsistent results of previous studies might not only result from differences in soils but also from the use of different extractants for the determination of plant available Si. (Crusciol et al., 2018) showed that correlations between plant available Si and Si in sugarcane were depending on soil texture and extractant (CaCl2, deionized water, KCl, Na-acetate buffer at pH 4.0, and acetic acid). In fact, there is no common standard procedure for the evaluation of plant available Si in soils because these procedures have been developed for specific plants in specific climates, i.e., mainly sugarcane and rice in (sub)tropical zones (cf. (Sauer et al., 2006). What we need now is detailed research on methods for a reliable determination of Si avail- ability in soils of the temperate zone. In this context, a combination of (i) different information on the Si status of soils (e.g., concentration of extractable plant available Si, quantity and quality of solid biogenic and pedogenic Si phases, retention of plant available Si in soils, influence of climate and vegetation) and (ii) laboratory and (long-term) field ex- periments (e.g., identifying of required concentrations of plant available Si in different soils for an optimal Si supply of specific crops) might be the most promising approach to enlighten the complex interactions in biogeochemical Si cycling. 4.4. Prevention of anthropogenic desilication by crop straw recycling In our study Si outputs via harvesting did not lead to a decrease of plant available Si in soils. Instead, the reverse is true and we found plant available Si in soils to increase with time (which is also reflected by increasing phytolith concentrations with time). We thus assign this in- crease directly to straw recycling as our data showed a positive rela- tionship between soil phytoliths (originating mainly from the applied straw) and plant available Si in soils. Moreover, we found only relatively low concentrations of ammonium oxalate-soluble Fe (i.e., Fe mainly from pedogenic amorphous silicates and organic complexes) in the Ap horizon of V140. As these concentrations were always lower than phy- tolith concentrations, we reasonably assume phytoliths to represent the main source of plant available Si in our study. In this context, it should be kept in mind that the phytoliths extracted from soil samples do not reflect the actual (total) phytolith input by crop straw recycling, because phytolith extraction is limited to a specific fraction of phytoliths (i.e., relatively stable phytoliths > 5 µm) (see discussion in (Kaczorek et al., 2019). Furthermore, phytoliths are characterized by differences in physicochemical properties (e.g., specific surface areas, dissolution signs, and differences on molecular levels) detectable via, e.g., infrared spectroscopy, confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy (Sommer et al., 2013; Puppe and Leue, 2018; Kaczorek et al., 2019). However, in our study we focused on harvest-related Si exports, corre- sponding effects of long-term Si losses on agricultural soil–plant systems, Geoderma403(2021)11518710D. Puppe et al. and potential prevention by straw recycling, which is why we did not perform such detailed, time-consuming spectroscopic and microscopic phytolith analyses. Surprisingly, the increase of plant available Si in soils was not limited to plots with straw recycling but occurred in all plots, and thus was also observable in control plots and plots without straw recycling. However, only in the plots with medium and high NPK fertilization rates and straw recycling (i.e., NPK3 + Straw and NPK5 + Straw) the observed increase in plant available Si in soils was statistically significant. We ascribe these observations to the fact that (i) all plots of V140 were regularly limed potentially leading to increased dissolution of amorphous silica in these plots (cf. (Guntzer et al., 2012) and (ii) crop straw recycling directly increased plant available Si in NPK + Straw plots. From our results we conclude that straw recycling does not only prevent anthropogenic desilication, but also replenishes plant available Si in soils with time (Fig. 9). In general, our results are corroborated by the findings of (Yang et al., 2020), who analyzed the long-term (36 years) influence of phytolith-rich straw recycling (three treatments: (i) NPK only, (ii) NPK + low straw rate (1/3 of total N fertilization), (iii) NPK + high straw rate (2/3 of total N fertilization)) and groundwater table management on labile Si soil fractions (determined by sequential chemical extraction using (i) CaCl2, (ii) acetic acid, (iii) H2O2, (iv) NH4-oxalate, and (v) Na2CO3) and Si uptake by rice in subtropical China. These authors found total labile Si concentrations to increase significantly with increasing phytolith-rich straw application, whereat the largest Si fraction in soils was represented by Na2CO3-Si, i.e., amorphous Si assumed to originate mainly from plants (phytoliths). While (Yang et al., 2020) found no significant differences between the three treatments (NPK, NPK + low straw rate, NPK + high straw rate) regarding plant available Si in soils (extracted via CaCl2), Si concentrations in cultured rice plants increased significantly with increasing straw recycling. The results of (Yang et al., 2020) and our results on hand clearly indicate the potential of straw recycling to compensate harvest-related Si losses from agricultural soil–plant systems, and thus to mitigate anthropogenic desilication in these systems. If we assume a linear in- crease of plant available Si in the analyzed soils, concentrations of plant available Si in NPK + Straw plots would double within 60–87 years (cid:0) 1 soil between 2036 and 2063 reaching values of about 10–13 mg Si kg (Fig. A8), thus resulting in plant available Si stocks of the order of the ones in natural ecosystems, e.g., forests, in the temperate zone (Puppe et al., 2015). Consequently, straw recycling might be the most promising strategy for the replenishment of plant available Si stocks in the temperate zone that were exhausted by industrial agriculture in the 19th (Second Agricultural Revolution, e.g., (Thompson, 1968) and 20th century (Third Agricultural Revolution, e.g., (Pellegrini and Fern´andez, 2018). Moreover, straw recycling might be also a promising way to enhance the water holding capacity of agricultural soils (Schaller et al., 2020), which is especially urgent against the background of increased drought events in some regions of the world due to climate change (Liu et al., 2018; Hari et al., 2020). Regular (annual) long-term incorporation of crop straw has also been found to be effective in soil erosion alleviation (Peng et al., 2016) and the enhancement of C sequestration (Song et al., 2016; Li et al., 2018; Barkusky et al., 2020; Berhane et al., 2020). In addition, our data indicate that straw recycling might have positive ef- fects on mobilization and utilization of plant available P in soils as Si and P compete for equivalent adsorption sites in soils. This is in accordance to the findings of studies on Si-P interactions in (agricultural) soils (e.g., (Ma and Takahashi, 1990; Schaller et al., 2020). Straw-derived P released by microbial decomposition and P occluded in phytoliths released by phytolith dissolution might also play a role in this context (Trinh et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2019). As plant available Si concentra- tions increased relatively slow in our study (doubling within 60–87 years) we reasonably assume P losses due to a potential over- mobilization and consequential leaching of phosphates to be low. Our results do not show a significant relationship between the concentra- tions of plant available Si and K in soils. Si fertilization might have positive effects on the K uptake by crops. However, corresponding re- sults published so far are ambiguous (see, e.g., (Puppe and Sommer, 2018 and references therein), and thus further research is needed to enlighten Si-K interactions in soils and plants. Finally, straw incorporation might be a potential alternative to open burning of straw in the field, which is still a common practice in many countries worldwide, although it has been widely criticized due to health (smog) and climate change (emissions of CO2) concerns (e.g., (Gustafsson et al., 2009). However, the ban of open straw burning has been discussed controversially (e.g., (Nguyen, 2020). Potential risks of crop straw incorporation include greenhouse gas emissions (microbial decomposition) and aggravation of plant pest infestation (Li et al., 2018). Future studies should focus on unraveling the mechanisms behind these aspects in different soil–plant systems to (i) find and evaluate solution strategies (e.g., implementation of innovative soil tillage practices like ditch-buried straw return, (Yang et al., 2019) to mitigate potential negative effects of crop straw recycling and (ii) establish regulations for purposeful crop straw recycling rates, and thus for sustainable, low fertilization agriculture. 4.5. Open questions In order to put the field regarding the potential of straw recycling for sustainable crop production forward the following key questions have to be resolved in future studies: (i) How can we reliably test agricultural soils on the need for Si supply? We urgently need standardized tests for quantification of plant available Si in agricultural soils. Due to the fact that several tests are used by researchers worldwide (reviewed by (Sauer et al., 2006), it is difficult to determine reliable lower limits for plant available Si in different soils, and thus for a need for Si supply (see the review of (Schaller et al., 2021). (ii) How much Si has to be accumulated in different plants at the minimum to obtain stress resistance? Although we know that Si accumulation in plants increases their resistance against abiotic and biotic stress, we do not know how much Si actually has to be accumulated to obtain this resistance. For sugarcane and rice production critical tissue Si values of 0.5–0.7% and 3–6% are stated in literature, respectively (Haynes, 2017 and references therein). However, there are no critical tissue Si values for other Si accumulating crops in literature to the best of our knowledge. Thus we urgently need field and laboratory experiments to examine said Si values for different crops. Only with this knowledge a targeted enhancement of crop resis- tance via Si supply will be possible and corresponding reductions in the use of pesticides and fertilizers can be optimized. (iii) Which crop straw recycling rates are needed for different crops? Only if we know how much Si in a given soil is plant available (see question (i) above) and how much Si has to be accumulated by the cultured crop to become stress resistant (see question (ii) above), we can define corresponding crop straw recycling rates. However, these rates will be not only dependent on soil Si availability and the Si need of the cultured crop, but also on, e.g., soil properties and microbiomes, agri- cultural practice (e.g., liming), climate conditions, and specific national regulations. Furthermore, differences in the release of Si from crop straw driven by, e.g., phytogenic Si concentrations of straw and straw-soil interactions have to be considered as well (Ma and Takahashi, 1989, 1991; Wickramasinghe and Rowell, 2006). Thus, much more work is required to (i) understand the complex interactions of the factors above for biogeochemical Si cycling in agricultural soil–plant systems and (ii) implement crop straw recycling in existing farming systems.

Conclusions Our results show that crop straw recycling prevents anthropogenic desilication and replenishes plant available Si stocks of agricultural soil–plant systems in the temperate zone. Plant available Si in agricul- tural soils would reach levels of plant available Si known from natural ecosystems within 60–87 years, if we assume a linear increase. Furthermore, our results indicate that yields at low (NPK1) and medium (NPK3) fertilization plots are statistically indistinguishable, and thus a reduction of N fertilization rates of about 69% (N rate of NPK1 vs. N rate of NPK3) is possible. This economy of the need for N fertilizers could be combined with the benefits of crop straw recycling (NPK1 + Straw), i.e., enhancement of C sequestration via straw inputs and prevention of anthropogenic desilication of agricultural soil–plant systems. Our study reveals that about 43–60% of Si exports can be saved by crop straw recycling in the long term. Si supply by crop straw recycling has the potential to act as a key management practice in sustainable, low fertilization agriculture in the future. In this context, the ultimate goal should be the restoration of natural Si recycling processes in agricultural ecosystems to the extent deemed possible.
