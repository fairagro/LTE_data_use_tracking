However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non-fertilized plots of three German long-term agricultural ex- periments in Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Mu¨ ncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha–1 each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha–1 or 0.1–0.4 g C kg–1 soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amend- ments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330(cid:2)C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520(cid:2)C. Furthermore, dif- ferences between measured (with TML110–550) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML330) and clay contents (with TML140) were confirmed as a suitable indi- cator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermog- ravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.

SOM influences the physical, chemical and bio- logical properties of soils, and SOM persistence determines ecosystem properties (Schmidt et al., 2011; Gregorich et al., 2015). The dynamics of SOM have significant importance for global carbon cycle (Field et al., 2007; Conant et al., 2011; Dignac et al., 2017) and SOM is recognized as key parameter to the sustainability of land use (Doran, 2002; Scheffer et al., 2010; Kleber and Lehmann, 2015). In agricultural soils, ferti- lizers and organic amendments, e.g., straw, farmyard man- * Correspondence: D. Tokarski; e-mail david.tokarski@lks-mbh.com ª 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Soil Sci. 2018, 181, 664–674 Contribution of organic amendments to soil organic matter 665 ure, and slurry manure, are frequently incorporated in soils to increase the SOM content. In addition, these fertilizers are subjected to alteration over time through decomposition re- lated to microbial immobilization and mineralization (Liu et al., 2006). These processes improve soil quality and nutrient availability for the plants, thus leading to improved crop yields (Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Ko¨ rschens et al., 2013). However, the influence of organic fertilizers and amendments on soil properties and soil functions can only be quantified to limited extend (Gray et al., 2011; Dignac et al., 2017). It seems difficult even to capture changes in organic carbon contents (Haynes and Naidu, 1998; Fontaine et al., 2003; Ferreras et al., 2006; Ka¨ tterer et al., 2014) under the influence of soil microorganisms, interaction with mineral soil compo- nents, differing climatic conditions, or soil management practi- ces. The most popular tool for ‘‘assessing’’ SOM is the determina- tion of the soil organic carbon (SOC) content (Haynes, 2005). Typical SOC quantifications are based on titrations, while oth- er use gravimetric, volumetric, spectrophotometric, or chro- matographic methods (Schumacher, 2002). Widely applied methods (Jandl et al., 2014) are Walkley–Black method (wet oxidation of organic carbon) (Walkley and Black, 1934), loss on ignition (LOI; determination of weight percent organic mat- ter), and dry combustion by elemental analysis (EA) with CO2 detection (Dean Jr., 1974; Nelson and Sommers, 1982). The Walkley–Black method is labor intensive and may lead to incomplete oxidation of organic carbon (Nelson and Sommers, 1996). LOI is a simple approach (Wang et al., 2012; Pallasser et al., 2013), but is characterized by limited accuracy (Wang et al., 2013; Ghabbour et al., 2014; Hoogsteen et al., 2015). SOC determination by EA is attrac- tive due to its reliability, accuracy, and relative low cost (Pallasser et al., 2013). Therefore, SOC content determina- tion by EA is in use as the most applied reference method (ISO, 1996) in laboratories with high sample throughput. The SOC content determination by EA is influenced by sam- pling methods as well as by the analytical accuracy. In litera- ture the overall detection limit is described with standard errors of around 1 g C kg–1 soil (Schumacher, 2002), whereas this method is much better the analytical accuracy of (0.1 g C kg–1 soil). Similar conclusions were reached by Ko¨ rschens (2010) and Gattinger et al. (2012) including the influence of soil sampling and other factors and implying high- er analytical accuracy. As a result, monitoring small changes in SOC content due to management change, for example, is still a challenging task as the background SOC stock is large (Jandl et al., 2014) and the level of SOC content remains diffi- cult to assess (Wessolek et al., 2008). Traditionally, organic matter content is determined via LOI (Dean Jr., 1974). It is based on the annealing of already oven dried samples in the muffle furnace at 550(cid:2)C for several hours. Thermogravimetry (TG) extends this procedure with modern thermobalances to continuously record mass losses during soil heating (Mass Losses on Ignition–MLI) (Oudghiri et al., 2014; Peikert et al., 2015; Kristl et al., 2016). Together with standardization of sample preparation and new evalu- ation algorithms, it allows determination of organic carbon, total organic nitrogen, clay, and carbonates with high accu- racy (Siewert, 2004). For example, SOC can be calculated using thermal mass loss (TML) between 320 and 330(cid:2)C men- tioned here as TML320–330. The content of organic nitrogen can be calculated using TML400–410 or TML320–330 as well, whereas for clay content determination close correlation to results of the standard pipette method were observed for TML120–130 and TML520–530 if the water content of air dried soil samples was equilibrated (Siewert and Kucˇ erı´k, 2015). Correlations between TML120–130 and TML520–530 were found to be predictive for the indirect detection of extraneous organ- ic carbon (e.g., charcoal, ashes, cinder, etc.) in soils, because this composition of organic matter causes increased mass losses in higher temperature ranges as compared to ‘‘native’’ SOM (Siewert and Kucˇ erı´k, 2015). Furthermore, TML used for SOC and clay content determinations correlate with MLI used for SOM content determination (Wang et al., 2013; Ghabbour et al., 2014; Hoogsteen et al., 2015). The transformed equation SOC = 0.48 · total organic matter – 0.12 · clay + 0.2 (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016) was found to be similar to other authors (Konen et al., 2002; de Vos et al., 2005; Wright et al., 2008) meaning broader applicability to different types of soils. These specifics of TG suggest the practical applicability for detection of changes in SOM considering interactions between soil components and providing informa- tion important for agricultural practice. Therefore, this work aimed to investigate the detection oppor- tunities for changes in the amount of SOM by thermogravime- try compared to elemental analysis and to determine the con- tribution of organic amendments to soil organic matter by using thermal decay dynamics. 2 Material and methods Model experiments consisted of artificially increasing the organic carbon content by adding various quantities of differ- ent types of organic amendments under laboratory conditions with subsequent analyses of mixtures with both EA and TG methods. We used different non-fertilized soils from long-term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs) to reduce unknown im- pacts of fertilizers. 2.1 Soil samples and organic amendments The soil samples were taken from the Ap-horizon (25 cm depth) from three LTAEs in Germany with varying clay and carbon contents. They were located in Mu¨ ncheberg (Brandenburg, Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research, Nutrition Increase Experiment, established 1963), Grossbeeren (Brandenburg, Leibniz Institute of Vegetable and Ornamental Crops, Static Fertilization Experiment, estab- lished 1989), and Bad Lauchsta¨ dt (Saxony-Anhalt, Centre for Environmental Research, Static Fertilization Experiment, established 1902). Detailed description of the experiments were given by Barkusky (2009), Ru¨ hlmann (2009), and Ko¨ rschens and Pfefferkorn (1998). the soil types and characteristics are provided below: Information of ª 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The SOC contents (non-fertilized soils) were 5, 8, and 16 g C kg–1 soil in Mu¨ ncheberg, Grossbeeren, and Bad Lauchsta¨ dt, respectively. The samples of each LTAE were mixed with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal, as examples of fre- quently applied agricultural amendments. They represent easily degradable plant residues (straw), classical organic fertilizers (farmyard manure and sheep faeces), and an exam- ple of black carbon application for soil property improvement (charcoal). The added quantities of organic amendments (Tab. 1) repre- senting (a) low rate for expected detection limit for changes in carbon content (0.1–0.4 g C kg–1, or 3 t ha–1 of organic amendments), (b) typical application rates in agricultural prac- tice (0.4–2.5 g C kg–1 or 20 t ha–1), and (c) the highest ferti- lization rates in long-term agriculture field experiments (1.3–7.5 g C kg–1, or 60 t ha–1, Ko¨ rschens et al., 2013). In order to consider the high differences in the content of dry mass in applied amendments (Tab. 1), farmyard manure and sheep faeces were added in additional extreme rates (3.8–5.0 g C kg–1 or 180 t ha–1 of organic amendments) in order to increase the comparability of added with straw and charcoal quantity of organic carbon. All of the artificial mix- tures consisted of 10 g soil with the organic amendment in the amount equivalent from 3 t ha–1 to 180 t ha–1. 2.2 Sample preparation and analysis After sampling with an auger, all soil samples were gently air dried and passed to a 2-mm sieve. In order to create compa- the air-dried samples were rable content of bound water, exposed to a relative air humidity of 76% (at 22(cid:2)C) for at least 2 weeks in desiccators. This conditioning exclude biodegra- dation at soil water content as close as possible to dry soils in field conditions (Siewert, 2001). The organic amendments were ground to 0.2 mm particle size (Retsch Ultra Centrifugal Mill ZM 200) after air-drying and, like the soil samples, stored at 76% relative humidity. After adding organic amendments into soils, the mixtures were immediately shaken for 2 h in an airtight glass container at room temperature (22(cid:2)C), and prior to thermogravimetric analyses again conditioned at 76% rela- tive air humidity for 2 weeks (Fig. 1).The analyses of organic carbon content of all samples were carried out in duplicate by dry combustion with a LECO TruMac CN analyser at a certi- fied laboratory of LKS mbH in Niederwiesa (Germany) using standard procedures (ISO, 1996).

Plant Nutr.

With increasing quantities of added charcoal, the results of TG deviated to a larger extent from predicted values (i.e., without charcoal) and from EA results (p < 0.001). Straw in contrast, caused an overestimation of carbon content in some samples by TG (p < 0.001), whereas in the case of farmyard manure and sheep faeces the carbon content determined by TG did not show deviations from predicted results and from results of EA. tween soil mixtures and non-fertilized soils in order to simplify demonstration of changes in organic carbon content by reducing the influence of different soil types. This makes the under- and overestimation of the carbon content of charcoal and straw by TG more visible. These effects were similar in all three soil types (LTAEs, sites) for all quantities and types of organic amendments (p < 0.001; Tab. 3). The only exclu- (t OA ha–1) as follows: heating 0.8 g–1.0 g of sample mass from 25 to 950(cid:2)C with heating rate of 5(cid:2)C min–1 and data acquisition of 1 reading per 4 seconds (one value per 0.3(cid:2)C temperature increase). Dur- ing the analytical procedure, the furnace with the sample was purged with a stream of air enriched by 76% relative humidity at 22(cid:2)C with a flow rate of » 200 mL min–1 (Siewert, 2004). TG analyses were carried out mostly in four replicates. 2.3 Data evaluation and statistical analysis The evaluation of results started with the reduction of data to the means of thermal mass losses in 10(cid:2)C temperature inter- vals. The resulting data are abbreviated here as TML (thermal mass losses) with given lower and upper temperature limit. For example, TML320–330 describes TML from 320(cid:2)C to 330(cid:2)C. During the next step of evaluation, the organic carbon contents were calculated from TML proposed by Siewert (2004) for soil property determination, with selected equation for TML320–330 because of the highest reliability and accuracy of this method. ) – g k g ( three soil The statistical analyses of changes in organic carbon content were carried out as multifactorial ANOVA with consideration of types (corresponding to sites of LTAE, factor A), four types of organic amendments (factor B), three or four quantities of added organic amendments (factor C), and both TG and EA methods for carbon content de- termination (factor D). A similar proce- dure was applied to the dynamics of TML in 10(cid:2)C temperature increase steps for organic carbon determination without factor D. For the comparison of selected means from main and combi- nation effects the Tukey-HSD-test was applied. o s l a n g i r o e h t d n a l i i s t n e m d n e m a d e d d a h t i w l i o s e h t f o C c i n a g r o n i s e c n e r e f f i D All statistical analyses were carried out using STATISTICA(cid:2) software (version 12.0) or Microsoft Excel(cid:2) (2013). All tests were repeatedly carried out in R-statistics for validation of results. 3 Results and discussion 3.1 Organic carbon content determination TG method showed significantly lower (p < 0.05; Tab. 2) organic carbon con- tents for non-fertilized initial soil sam- ples than the EA method (Tab. 2). In natural soils a better comparability of both methods was found (Siewert, 2001; 2004). We hypothesized, that TG preferentially detects biologically trans- formed organic carbon, whereas ele- mental analysis detect the total carbon content. After adding low quantities from different long term field experiments measured with EA and TG, presented as differences of measured organic C content of the soils with added OA minus the original soil (non-fertilized soil). Error bars indicate – standard error of the means. ª 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Summarizing these results, TG seems to have a limited ability to capture changes in organic carbon in soils containing organic amendments. The limited applicability of TG to soil organic carbon, however, is a known phenomenon. Devia- tions between EA and TG are described in Siewert (2004) as a possible consequence of extraneous carbon, which has not undergone stabilization processes as a part of biological reg- ulation during soil formation. This effect may be reduced by biological transformation during digestion and composting. Siewert (2004) and Kucˇ erı´k et al. (2013) found increasing lim- itations in soil property determination via TML in dependency on quantity and quality of added organic carbon from anthro- pogenic materials (such as charcoal, ashes, cinder, etc.). Fur- thermore the level of transformation of organic amendments into SOM through storage, digestion, composting, etc., should be considered. This limits the applicability of TG for soil property determination. Nevertheless, it offers new oppor- tunities for diagnostics of anthropogenic influences by analyz- ing of thermal decay profiles of individual organic amend- ments. 3.2 Thermal decay dynamics for the detection of different organic amendments soils from Bad Lauchsta¨ dt, Grossbeeren, and Mu¨ ncheberg before and after adding the highest rates of added organic amendments (60 t ha–1 of straw and charcoal, 180 t ha–1 of farmyard manure and sheep faeces). It reveals the soil influ- ence on dynamics of thermal decay and their changes by added organic amendments. In all soil types (LTAEs, sites) a similar general trend was observed. Most changes have been in temperature observed between 200(cid:2)C and 550(cid:2)C, i.e., ª 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The position and intensity of the thermal decay peaks depended on the type of added organic amend- ments. For example, addition of straw or sheep faeces mainly resulted in changing mass losses around 300(cid:2)C with a peak for sheep faeces at 280(cid:2)C and for straw at 310(cid:2)C. In contrast, charcoal application caused the highest increase of mass losses at higher temperature around 500(cid:2)C, whereas farm- yard manure degraded continuously in a wide range of tem- perature between 250 and 510(cid:2)C. ics of mixtures (60 t ha–1 of straw and charcoal, 180 t ha–1 of farmyard manure and sheep faeces) and non-fertilized soils calculated for every soil It reveals similar changes in all soil types under the influence of type (LTAEs, sites) separately. organic amendments, which causes individual changes in temperature ranges between 200 and 550(cid:2)C. In turn, TG-fin- gerprinting could be possible for detection of organic amend- ments. However, in temperature ranges from 30 to 200(cid:2)C, peak shifts appear to be dependent on soil type. The temperature area used for organic carbon determination (TML320–330) was influenced by thermal decay dynamics of organic amendments in a different way. For example, addition of straw with a peak temperature around 300(cid:2)C (Blanco and Almendros, 1994; Lopez-Capel et al., 2006) had higher peak intensity.

Following these considerations, a combined application of two or more of the amendments will increase uncertainties when using the TG method for detec- tion of carbon in soils and of the quality of SOM. TML’s (TML120–130 and TML520–530) were found to correlate with each other. Both of these temperature ranges can be used to predict soil clay content (Siewert, 2004). Our current study confirmed deviations of TML520–530, because thermal stabile organic amendments produce mass losses above the level caused by clay content. This finding was suggested for indi- rect detection of black carbon in soils (Leifeld et al., 2007; Siewert and Kucˇ erı´k, 2015). s e s s o l s s a m l a m r e h t n i s e g n a h C ) p e t s C ° n i – g g m ( experiments. The largest deviations from correla- tion between TML for clay content determination can be observed for the highest quantities of added charcoal because of the increased thermal mass losses at TML520–530. larger quantities of straw, farmyard manure, and sheep faeces produced a shift of results in direction of higher TML120–130, which may be explained by additional water binding of organic amendments. In contrast, The higher thermal stability of charcoal (Leifeld et al., 2007; Plante et al., 2009; Cimo` et al., 2014) caused shifts to higher TML 520–530(cid:2)C values (y-axis). In case of fresh organic residues we found a trend of increased TML 120–130(cid:2)C values (x-axis). However, this effect is difficult to quantify, because of the unknown impact of water-binding on thermal decay dynamics. Another approach to detect changes in SOM is based on comparing measured mass loss on igni- tion (MLI) by estimation using both organic carbon and clay contents (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016). Once the organic carbon and clay content can be calculated such as from TML330 and TML140 (Siewert, 2004), both measured and calculated MLI can be extracted from TG records (see Fig. 6a; with MLIcalculated = 10 · TML140 + 25 · TML330–2 and MLImeasured = TML110–550). The MLI values vary as expected with soil types (LTAEs, sites), and with type and quantity of organic amendments. Within every LTAE, non-fertilized plots had the lowest values. Adding higher quantities of organic amendments resulted in increased MLI. The different levels of values between soil types hamper comparing of fertilization effects. measured MLI. A site specific initial value could be detected for every type of soil (LTAE, sites) without any organic amendment fertilization over decades (small grey columns in Fig. 6b). In case of Mu¨ ncheberg the non-fertilized soil had negative values. This may indicate a poorer supply with fresh organic matter in comparison to other sites. With increasing quantities of added straw, farmyard man- the values ure, and sheep faeces, increased in all soil types. Charcoal had contrasting effect. These results support suggestions about differences in MLI that could indicate changes in SOM supply of soils with higher content of biological degradable organic amendments (Kucˇ erı´k et al., 2016). Temperature (°C) added organic amendments at every site presented as differences between mixtures and of non-fertilized soils. Comparing different organic amendments, straw had the highest impact on predicted and measured MLI and is known for high biodegradability (Hansen et al., 2016). ª 2018 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It confirms the effect of the degree of biological degradation of the organic amendments on its detectability via thermal decay dynamics. This is a topic in a further study, which focusses on detectability of changes in thermal decay dynam- ics caused by biological degradation during incu- bation. Furthermore, possible interactions with soil–clay minerals should be considered (Pronk et al., 2012; 2013) as a factor forming thermally more stable compounds. These results and the dynamics of thermal decay offer new approaches for the detec- tion of qualitative changes in the SOM composition for practical issues. Farmyard manure and sheep faeces showed lower impact, because they already underwent transformation processes during digestion and composting.

However, both EA and TG methods do not allow the detection of very low quantities of added organic carbon due to limits of detection. Different peak temperatures in thermal decay dynamics of investigated types of organic amendments can cause both over- and underestimation of organic carbon content by using TG method. Due to these features, the peak heights and posi- tions can be used as a fingerprinting tool which provides char- acteristics of the quality of added organic amendments inde- pendently of soil type. The tested method offer detection abil- types and quantities of added organic ities for different amendments. They could enable high sensitive detection of changes in soil organic matter composition by adding different organic fertilizers.
