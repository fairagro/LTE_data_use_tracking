Here, we show that reformation of the fertile topsoil and crop yield increase is possible by good agricultural management within a few decades. Evi- dence relies on a unique long-term field experiment in NE Germany, where in 1964 the sandy soil (Luvisol) had been excavated to 52 cm and refilled with subsoil material of 52 cm thickness. Undisturbed trials served as controls, these were all combined with either no fertilisation, mineral fertilisation or a combined mineral and organic fertilisation. It took only 26 years until new topsoil had been formed. Its soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks and the aggregate size distributions equalled that of the other treatments; SOC sequestration (cid:0) 1. The former topsoil buried below the plough layer lost 30–50 percent of its SOC corresponded to 28 Mg SOC ha during 5 decades in a non-linear manner. We conclude that our current agricultural tools can restore degraded arable land rather fast and contribute to climate change mitigation through a significant SOC sequestration as well. 1. Introduction Most agricultural soils of the world have lost carbon (C) from some parts of or the whole topsoil due to inadequate management (Sander- man et al., 2017). However, this historical C loss also provides a chance to re-sequester significant amounts of new C and, therewith, to improve soil fertility and yields (Amelung et al., 2020; Blanco-Canqui & Lal, 2004). While there are many practices in place to sequester C by agri- cultural management (Amelung et al., 2020; Lessmann et al., 2022; Paustian et al., 2019; Sykes et al., 2020), little is known about their ef- ficiency in situations where topsoil has been lost due to erosion and when new topsoil is reforming. Restoring degraded topsoils is particularly important for sandy soils, where low fertility may be closely correlated to low carbon content (Lobe et al., 2005; Schindler et al., 2007). However, our knowledge on the rates of C sequestration in degraded sandy soils is still incomplete. Preger et al. (2010) reported limited C sequestration when degraded sandy arable soils of the subtropics were turned into secondary pastures. The authors assumed that the limited success was due to insufficient N fertilisation and high soil compaction. Studies in temperate climates suggested that 45 years on average after deep ploughing, C accumulated in the new topsoil, but topsoil C stocks were still lower than in reference plots without deep ploughing (Alc´antara et al., 2016). This effect was most profound on sandy non-fertilised deep-ploughed forest soils, whereas the SOC deficit on sandy cropland soils was smaller than that on the control plot, due to fertilisation of the croplands. Hence, inputs of organic matter and (mineral) nutrients are important factors that control C storage in soils (Amelung et al., 2020; Lessmann et al., 2022; Six et al., 2002). Increased C storage in soils may be achieved by adding organic material such as straw or compost or using mineral fertiliser to increase root and residue C input into the soil with higher yield (Christensen, 1986; Liu et al., 2014; Powlson et al., 2012; van Groenigen et al., 2006). However, the additional C is stored only when the soil is not N-limited (van Groenigen et al., 2006; van Groenigen et al., 2017). Nevertheless, Liu et al. (2014) showed that straw incorporation into sandy soils increased the soil organic matter (OM) pool, and improved nutrient status and soil structure. Other studies have emphasised the success of organic fertiliser such as compost to recover OM stocks in burnt soils or in soils affected by erosion (Su et al., 2010).

Burger et al. that, with the rise in OM content in loamy and sandy loam soils after straw incorporation, macroaggregate formation was also enhanced, suggesting that soil aggregate formation promotes increased C storage (Six et al., 2002). Aggregates promote long-term C storage in soils by physically pro- tecting the enclosed OM against microbial degradation (Bronick & Lal, 2005). According to the concept of aggregate hierarchy (Oades, 1984; Tisdall & Oades, 1982), soil macroaggregates (>250 µm) are composed of microaggregates (smaller than 250 µm) and primary particles, held together mainly by roots and fungal hyphae. Within this concept of aggregate hierarchy, microaggregates have a turnover rate of decades and are rarely affected by land management, whereas macroaggregates have a turnover rate of years or shorter and are thus sensitive to man- agement (Puget et al., 2000). In this regard, soil C losses have frequently been associated with a loss of C in macroaggregates, which decay rapidly with prolonged tillage (Lobe et al., 2011; Six et al., 2000; Six et al., 1998). In return, it may take two decades after the end of tillage prac- tices until a new steady-state equilibrium similar to the original macroaggregate content is established, as shown for subtropical sandy soils (K¨osters et al., 2013). However, nothing is known about macro- aggregate reformation in former subsoils that are included into man- agement (such as after erosion), nor on aggregate preservation in, for example, colluvial deposits when the thickness of the A horizon exceeds that of the common plough layer. To study the long-term effects of fertilisation and soil aggregation on C sequestration in sandy topsoils and subsoils, we take advantage of a manipulative, long-term field experiment established in 1964 in Mün- cheberg on sandy Luvisols in eastern Germany (in the former German Democratic Republic, GDR). In this experiment, complete removal or duplication of topsoil (Ap) was combined with different fertiliser re- gimes (no fertiliser, mineral, mineral + organic fertiliser) (Herzog & Kunze, 1976). In 1975, the soil properties of the field experiment were analysed to test the effects of the topsoil removal or duplication in combination with the fertiliser regime (Herzog & Kunze, 1976). The topsoil removal can be taken as an analogue of extreme erosion, whereas topsoil duplication reflects an artificial colluvium formation. When the GDR became part of Federal Republic of Germany, the field experiment was abandoned, and the site was managed by conventional farming. We now resampled the former experimental plots to study C storage 55 years after the installation of the field experiment. We hypothesised that (1) after topsoil removal, a substantial part of the carbon stock was lost, although this may be recovered after 55 years of management, (2) duplication of the topsoil will not succeed in maintaining elevated C stocks, (3) N fertilisation is essential for sequestering C in all treatments, and (4) the gain in soil organic carbon (SOC) is closely related to macroaggregate formation in these sandy soils. 2. Methods 2.1. Study site ◦ ◦ N, 14.1344 The historical long-term field experiment V210 is located at the Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF) in Müncheberg, ◦ North-Eastern Germany (52.5209 E). Mean annual pre- cipitation equals 531 mm (1961–1990) and 550 mm (1991–2020), respectively. The mean annual air temperature increased from 8.3 C C (1991–2020). The relief of the V210 is almost (1961–1990) to 9.4 flat, although slightly convex and concave parts can be identified. The soil was classified as Albic Luvisol (Arenic, Neocambic) (IUSS, 2015). It has developed from a sandy glacial till overlying glaciofluvial sands. The depth to the Bt is highly variable, but most of the Bt horizons started below 52 cm in 1964, resulting in minor clay inclusions at different depths in the subsoil of some of the plots, while the general texture of the soil remained homogenous within the first 52 cm of soil. General soil properties are given in Table S1. ◦ The field experiment was established in 1964 with four different soil manipulation treatments, each combined with four fertiliser regimes, for this study only three out of four soil manipulation treatments and three out of four fertilisation regimes were considered. The three soil manipulation treatments sampled for this study included a control, a treatment with total removal of the topsoil, and a topsoil duplication treatment. For the no-topsoil and double-topsoil treatments, the soil was excavated to 52 cm depth and separated into topsoil (0–26 cm depth) and subsoil (26–52 cm). The excavated soil material was sieved to remove stones >3 cm and refilled either with only subsoil material in the topsoil removal treatment or with only topsoil material in the topsoil duplication treatment (Fig. 1; Table 1, Fig. S2). The fertiliser regimes per topsoil treatment were no fertilisation (b1), mineral fertilisation (b2), and a combination of reduced mineral N fertilisation with organic manure (b4 with higher organic amendments compared to b3), where the organic fertiliser compensates the reduction in mineral fertiliser. The organic fertiliser consisted of straw, farmyard manure, slurry, solid manure, and peat compost. The experiment was abandoned in 1991. Since then, the plots have been integrated into a larger conventional agricultural field with standard mineral fertilisation (b2) but without organic manure. The plots of the former treatments were recovered in 2015 using two permanent fix points (pumping stations), an aerial photograph from 1980 and a trench (see Fig. S1 in the supplement). Table S3 and Fig. S5 show the yield development from 1962 until 1982 and from 2015 until 2020. 2.2. Sampling procedure and basic analyses The historical experiment V210 was re-established as a long-term field experiment in 2015 and is now under ongoing observation by ZALF (Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research, Müncheberg, Ger- many). Hence, any disturbances should be kept to a minimum. In 2019, that is, 55 years after the start of the experiment, two soil cores each were taken from centre of all reconstructed plots. Overall, the cores from 36 plots were chosen for analysis for this study: a control (TC) and two topsoil manipulation treatments (topsoil removal: TR, topsoil duplica- tion: TD) times three fertilisation regimes (no fertilisation (b1), mineral fertilisation (b2), combined mineral and organic fertilisation (b4)) with four field replicates each. These plots were chosen because they repre- sented the extremes of all treatments and only two samples were suffi- cient as the spatial variability of soil properties was already reduced in 1964 in the manipulation plots (TR, TD) due to the initial homogeni- sation of the soil material (sieving, mixing, refilling). Before soil coring, we had carried out a geophysical survey (EM38), which confirmed very small variance in the apparent electrical conductivity within each of the plot. The remaining larger spatial variance across the experimental site was captured by the four plot replicates. We used polypropylene (PP) tubes with a nominal diameter of 63 mm and a length of 60 cm. Each PP tube was inserted in a closed, metal tube (M22; Nordmeyer Geotool, Herne, Germany) and pushed into the soil by a hydraulic hammer coupled to a tractor (customised tool by Nordmeyer Geotool, Herne, Germany). Cores were separated into sub- samples of 0–20 cm, 20–26 cm, 26–30 cm, 30–45 cm and 45–60 cm depth, reflecting a combination of sampling depth recommendations by the German Inventory of Soil Agriculture and morphological horizon boundaries. The weight of the core increments per depth interval was recorded and later corrected for soil water content to calculate dry bulk density. Half of the sample (cut vertically from the core) at 0–20 cm was kept as an undisturbed sample for aggregate and density fractionation. ◦ All other samples were dried at 40 C, passed through a 2 mm sieve and milled. An aliquot of the milled sample material was analysed for total carbon and total nitrogen (N) contents by elemental analysis (vario EL cube; Elementar, Hanau, Germany). A subsample of soil horizons clas- sified as Bt or Ck horizon (IUSS, 2015) were tested for carbonate content by Scheibler’s method and organic and inorganic carbon were deter- mined after dry combustion and separated by sequential heating using a soil TOC Cube (Elementar Analysensysteme, Hanau, Germany).

Before 1991, total C was ◦ determined by dry combustion at 850 C (TGL 25418/04, 1976). As the upper 52 cm contained no carbonates, total C equals SOC. 2.3. Aggregate fractionation frozen and lyophilised (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Weights of the aggregate fractions were determined and the aggregate fractions of the field replicates were pooled per depth, treatment and fertiliser regime for subsequent density fractionation. Small aliquots (0.5 g) of the pooled aggregate fractions were taken for elemental analysis. For aggregate fractionation, we concentrated on the treatments without fertilisation or with combined mineral and organic fertiliser application, assuming that these represent the most extreme effects. Prior to wet sieving, the undisturbed sample was slowly wetted for 5 min by placing it on the top sieve of the sieving tower at the water surface. Wet sieving of undisturbed samples was conducted on a sieving tower with sieves of 2000 µm, 250 µm, 53 µm and 20 µm mesh size (Retsch®, Haan, Germany) with equipment and method details outlined by Krause et al. (2018). The sieve tower was moved 3 cm up and down in a water tank for 15 min at an oscillation speed of 30 rounds per minute. The fractions were collected from the sieves by rinsing into a glass flask, 2.4. Density fractionation The aliquots obtained for the aggregate fraction 53–20 µm were too small for density fractionation and were not processed further. For all other pooled aggregate fractions, density fractionation with 40 mL of (cid:0) 1 sodium polytungstate (SPT) solution was carried out by 1.6 g mL centrifugation at 3000 rounds per minute (rpm) (ThermoFisher Scien- tific, Waltham, USA) for one hour to separate the light fraction (ρ < 1.6 (cid:0) 1). The supernatants and pellets were collected and the pellets g mL (cid:0) 1 were centrifuged again at 3000 rpm for one hour with a 2.5 g mL sodium polytungstate solution to separate the intermediate fraction (1.6 Geoderma434(2023)1164923D.J. Burger et al. (cid:0) 1 < ρ < 2.5 g mL (cid:0) 1) from the heavy fraction (ρ > 2.5 g mL (cid:0) 1). The g mL light, intermediate and heavy fractions corresponded to the Particulate Organic Matter (POM), aggregates and mineral fraction, respectively. All fractions were collected and sequentially washed with a 0.1 M HCl solution and deionised water to remove the SPT from the fractions. After density fractionation, the fractions were frozen, lyophilised and ana- lysed for total C and total N content by elemental analysis. 2.5. Statistical analysis The carbon stocks stored in the aggregate or POM fraction were calculated by correcting the carbon stock for the mass proportion of the fraction after Six et al. (1998), with the following equation. Cstockfraction (cid:0) Mg ha(cid:0) 1 ) (cid:0) = (cid:0) g kg(cid:0) 1 Cfraction ) ) × massproportionfraction (cid:0) kg dm(cid:0) 3 ) × depthinterval(dm) × drybulkdensity (1) For data evaluation, we used the control under the different fertil- isation regimes as a reference for calculating C stock changes in the topsoil removal and duplication treatment. These stock changes then represent net C and N storage or loss for each specific treatment under the given experimental and environmental conditions at the site over a period of 55 years. To calculate stock changes in the topsoil, the dif- ferences in C stocks were calculated between the current subsoil (26–52 cm) of the control plot and the current topsoil (0–26 cm) of the topsoil removal treatment (formerly also at 26–52 cm soil depth), as well as the differences between the current topsoil (0–26 cm) of the control treatment and the current topsoil (0–26 cm) of the topsoil doubling treatment. For assessing the changes in stocks in the subsoil, the dif- ferences between the subsoil (52–78 cm) of the control treatment and the subsoil (26–52 cm) of the topsoil removal treatment, as well as the differences between the control treatment (0–26 cm) and the subsoil of the topsoil doubling treatment (26–52 cm) were calculated for every replicate. (cid:0) 2 or bulk density of 1.46 Mg m (cid:0) 3, 26 cm, derived from Herzog 1984 and 1.37 Mg m We investigated changes in SOC accrual in two ways. First, we looked at a time series until the end of the experiment in 1991, which represents a series of measurements with the same method. SOC concentrations of the first 26 years were derived from data from Herzog and Kunze (1976), Herzog (1988), and Herzog (1990). The SOC stocks during the experi- ment were calculated by taking an average topsoil fine-earth mass of (cid:0) 2 derived from (cid:0) 3 (400 kg m 383 kg m (cid:0) 2 measured in 2019, bulk density = 1.55 Mg Herzog 1984 and 365 kg m (cid:0) 3, 26 cm, m measured in 2019). We visualised in SOC stocks with a range between bulk densities of the beginning and end of the experiment (Fig. S2). SOC sequestration rates were calculated by performing a linear regression analysis in RStudio and MS Excel. Secondly, we used our own mea- surements of 2019 done where the control treatment with different fertilisation regimes is used as reference for the topsoil removal and duplication treatment to compare SOC stocks in the treatments with those of the control at the time of sampling. Before carrying out data analysis on carbon stocks, nitrogen stocks and C:N ratios, normality and homoscedasticity of data subsets per soil depth and variable were evaluated. Normality and homoscedasticity term field experiment V210 (Herzog & Kunze,1976; Herzog, 1988, 1990); LSD (5%) for topsoil treatments at 0–26 cm: 0.05% SOC (1976), 0.13% SOC(1983) and 0.19% SOC (1990); LSD (5%) for topsoil treatments at 26–52 cm: 0.05% SOC (1976); data from the 2019 sampling campaign (64 plots) are added after axis break (error bars represent the standard deviation of four replicates). Geoderma434(2023)1164924D.J. Burger et al. criteria were met for all data was normally distributed, except from subsoil N stocks. Since the subsoil N stocks were not normally distrib- uted, we log transformed the data, which then approached normal dis- tribution. Differences in carbon stocks, nitrogen stocks and C:N ratios in the topsoil and subsoil were analysed by two-way ANOVA correcting for block design in R according to Iqbal Jeelani et al. (2018). After the two- way ANOVA tests, contrast analyses were carried out and significant differences were tested for the least significant difference (LSD). 3. Results 3.1. Soil organic carbon dynamics 1964–1990 The manipulation experiment started with quite low SOC contents in the upper part (0–26 cm) of the soil profiles in 1964 (t0 ~0.5 percent SOC in TC, TD, Fig. 2, upper graphs). The active topsoil removal (TR) further reduced SOC by 60–80 percent compared to the control plots (TC). Thereafter, however, SOC contents increased with prolonged arable cropping after a certain lag phase. This lag phase was shortest in the trials receiving both organic and inorganic fertilisation (Fig. 2), and longest in the unfertilised trials; the mineral-N fertilised trials being intermediate. Hence, both the time of topsoil recovery and the rate of SOC sequestration strongly depended on the fertiliser regime and topsoil management. As management proceeded, the spatial variability of SOC also decreased, as evident from an decrease in LSD from 0.05 percent soil (1975) to 0.02 percent (1990). The 2019 values fit well into the temporal trends derived from the serial measurements until 1990 for all treatments except for those with additional organic fertiliser (b4). This indicates that SOC contents further increased from 1990 until 2019 in the upper 26 cm. This is not the case for the organic fertiliser trials, which showed a loss of SOM after ending the experiment in 1991. This is further supported by a re-analysis of archived samples from another long-term field experiment at ZALF (V140), which showed a close fit of SOC along the 1:1 line when comparing former and recent analytical methods (data not shown). Overall, a 20 percent decrease from the 1990 level was observed in the organic fertilised trials, reflecting the cessation of manuring after the end of the experiment, likely because the organic input decreased. When considering the period from 1964 to 1990, topsoil removal in combination with organic fertilisation (b4) resulted in the largest SOC increase. Without any fertiliser (b1) and with mineral fertilisation (b2), TR approached the SOC level of TC after 26 years. This translated into a (cid:0) 1 in 26 years (0.46 Mg SOC mean total C sequestration of 12 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1) in topsoils only. TC and topsoil duplication (TD) with ha either mineral fertiliser or no fertiliser only showed a slight increase in topsoil SOC after 26 years. Organic manuring resulted in a doubling of the initial SOC content (1964) in variants TC and TD. (cid:0) 1 year The rates of carbon sequestration in the first 26 years of the experi- ment (Fig. S4) in the control plot (TC) were 0.28 (R2 = 0.83, p < 0.05) (cid:0) 1 SOC 1 per year (R2 = 0.94, p < 0.01) per year in the and 0.84 Mg ha mineral (b2) and combined (b4) fertiliser treatments, respectively; the no-fertiliser treatment had no significant SOC sequestration. In the topsoil removal treatment (TR), the yearly rate of SOC sequestration was (cid:0) 1 0.57 (R2 = 0.87, p < 0.05), 0.69 (R2 = 0.92, p < 0.01), and 1.32 Mg ha SOC (R2 = 0.99, p < 0.001) under the no-fertiliser treatment (b1), the mineral (b2), and combined (b4) fertiliser treatments, respectively. The yearly SOC sequestration rate in the topsoil duplication treatment (TD) was not significant in the no-fertiliser treatment (b1), and was 0.23 (R2 (cid:0) 1 SOC (R2 = 0.96, p < 0.01) in the = 0.86, p < 0.05) and 1.04 Mg ha respective mineral (b2) and combined (b4) fertiliser treatments. standard error of the treatment mean (n = 4). Treatments with a different letter (a or b) have significantly different SOC stocks. Sampling and measurements were conducted in 2019. Geoderma434(2023)1164925D.J. Burger et al. The SOC contents of subsoils (26–52 cm, historical data only until 1984) in TC and TR did not change significantly over time (Fig. 2, lower graphs). By contrast, SOC of topsoil duplication (TD) treatments decreased from the original level in 1964 until 1984 depending on the fertiliser regime: SOC is reduced by 25 percent in plots with organic fertiliser (b4), 33 percent in the mineral (b2) and 45 percent in the no (cid:0) 1 in fertiliser treatment (b1). On average, TD subsoils lost 7 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1 y-1). As subsoil SOC contents did not change 20 years (-0.35 Mg C ha significantly until 2019, long-term stability of subsoil SOC can be assumed, even for the topsoil duplication treatment. In the subsoil, the spatial variability was low at all treatments, as LSD equalled 0.05 percent soil. 3.2. Soil carbon and nitrogen stocks after 55 years In the bulk soil, the plots of the treatment with topsoil duplication and combined organic and mineral fertilisation had the highest SOC stocks in both topsoil (0–26 cm) and subsoil (26–52 cm), and, thus, within the total profile (Fig. 3A). In the topsoil, these differences in carbon stocks were not significant between any of the treatments, as indicated by similar lowercase letters in Fig. 3A. Intriguingly, this also means that the combined organic and mineral fertilisation did not consistently result in higher SOC stocks than the other trials; even the trials without fertilisation did not show reduced SOC stocks compared with the fertilised trials (Fig. 3A). In the subsoil, SOC stocks differed significantly from each other (p < 0.001): the treatments with topsoil duplication showed larger subsoil SOC stocks (in this case, the subsoil is former topsoil, now below the plough layer) than the other treatments (p < 0.001). The topsoil SOC stocks of the topsoil removal treatments were significantly (p < 0.001) larger in the first 26 cm soil than in the respective subsoils of the control, and they had increased relative to the starting point of the experiment. This means the former subsoil had gained SOC. Elevated subsoil C stocks were also found in the topsoil removal treatment without fertilisation; these plots had some clay inclusions. SOC stocks in the total profile (0–52 cm) were lowest in the control plot and highest in topsoil dupli- cation (p < 0.05; Fig. 3A), while total N stocks (0–52 cm) were not significantly different among all treatments (Fig. 3B). The C:N ratios varied between 10.0 and 11.3in the topsoil and be- tween 5.1 and 9.0 in the subsoil. There were no significant differences in the topsoil. In the subsoil, the C:N ratios differed significantly (p < 0.001), the C:N ratios of the topsoil duplication treatment were signif- icantly higher than those of the two other treatments (p < 0.01) (cid:0) 1 in (Fig. 3C). As a result, total N stocks varied from 2.7 and 2.1 Mg ha (cid:0) 1 in the subsoil (Fig. 3B). The N stocks the topsoil and 0.8 and 1.6 Mg ha in the topsoil did not differ significantly between the three fertilisation regimes. In the subsoil, however, the log-transformed N stocks differed significantly between the three treatments (p < 0.01): the subsoil log- transformed N stocks of the topsoil duplication treatment were signifi- cantly larger than in the control plot and the topsoil removal treatment. There were no significant differences between the different fertilisation regimes. Comparing the SOC stocks in the topsoil removal and topsoil dupli- cation treatments with those of the control at a given fertilisation regime can be we used to calculate net SOC stock changes over the whole period of 55 years. Within the soil profiles of the topsoil removal treatments, C stocks in topsoils increased more than in the subsoil, effects were similar among all fertilisation regimes. The calculation confirmed that all treatments with topsoil removal showed a net gain in SOC, while those with topsoil duplication showed a net loss over the last 55 years, which involves both C input and decomposition (Fig. 4A). As indicated above, the latter was not due to SOC loss from the topsoil but from the subsoil, (cid:0) 1 on average over the last 55 accounting for a SOC loss of <20 Mg ha years from the relict Ap horizon (=former topsoil), now being in the subsoil below the plough layer (Fig. 4A).

A similar change in stocks was observed for N, with a net increase in N stocks in the trials that experienced a removal of the topsoil but a net N loss in the double topsoil treatments, compared to the treatments that had no specific topsoil management (Fig. 4B). The greatest net increase of total N was observed for the combined fertilisation trials after topsoil removal, whereas the largest N losses occurred in the non-fertilised trials after topsoil duplication. Within the topsoil duplication trial, the subsoil N losses differed significantly (p < 0.1), with the largest difference be- tween the non-fertilised trials and the two trials with fertilisation. Thus, a lack of N fertilisation resulted in the largest SOC losses of the topsoil duplication trials, although this effect was not observed in the topsoil removal trials. 3.3. Soil organic carbon stock in aggregates Aggregate fractionation yielded substantial amounts of material in the fractions commonly assigned to macro (>250 µm)- and micro- aggregates (<250 µm) (Table S4), but large portions of these fractions were primary particles. After density fractionation, the mass percent- (cid:0) 1 ages of the aggregates in the density range of 1.6 to 2.5 g mL accounted for 0.26 to 1.02 percent of soil weight only, with an average of 0.55 percent (Table S5). The mass percentages of POM ranged from 0.71 percent to 0.25 percent, being on average 0.48 percent of mass of the soil sample (Table S5). Hence, these sandy soils were poorly aggregated. On average, 3.0 ± 0.5 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1 were stored within these ag- gregates (Fig. 5A). The largest amount of SOC was stored in the aggre- gates of the topsoil removal treatments with combined organo-mineral (cid:0) 1). The lowest amounts of aggregate- fertilisation (4.3 Mg SOC ha associated SOC were found in the topsoil duplication treatments (1.4 (cid:0) 1). Except for controls, the SOC stocks within aggregates Mg SOC ha were larger under combined mineral and organic fertiliser application than in the non-fertilised trials. The fertilisation in these treatments promoted the storage of C in all aggregate fractions. The average stocks of SOC stored as POM (light fraction, ρ < 1.6 g (cid:0) 1) were of a similar magnitude to the amounts stored in aggregates, mL (cid:0) 1. The largest POM-C stock was amounting to 3.0 ± 0.3 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1) and those with topsoil dupli- found in the control plots (4.2 Mg ha cation, whereas the lowest amounts of POM were found in the fertilised (cid:0) 1; Fig. 5B). Without topsoil removal, topsoil removal trials (2.2 Mg ha the C stocks within the POM fraction were increased under combined mineral and organic fertiliser application (Fig. 5B). When relating the SOC stored within aggregates to that in the bulk soil, on average, 14.2 percent ± 2.9 percent of bulk soil carbon in the topsoils were stored within aggregates, with the highest percentages in the non-fertilised controls (25.0 percent) and the lowest ones in the non- fertilised treatments with topsoil duplication (6.4 percent). Except for controls, the percentage of the total SOC stock stored within aggregates were larger under combined mineral and organic fertiliser applications (Fig. 5C). The portions of SOC stored as POM were similar as those stored in aggregates: 13.3 ± 1.3 percent of bulk SOC were POM. The percentages were largest for the unfertilised topsoil duplication treatment (16.9 percent) and the lowest for the fertilised treatments with topsoil removal (8.3 percent; Fig. 5D). In all treatments, except for the controls, the percentages of the C stored as POM were lower under combined mineral and organic fertiliser applications. Geoderma434(2023)1164928D.J. Burger et al.

Discussion 4.1. Soil organic carbon dynamics (cid:0) 1 year Twenty-six years after the experiment in Müncheberg was initiated, the C stocks of the treatments that had undergone a topsoil removal had similar topsoil C stocks to the controls. Hence, we may support our first hypothesis that losses of SOC with topsoil removal did not persist over six decades. Indeed, the results of this study showed that the former subsoil was able to sequester enough C to replace the SOC that was lost in topsoil removal rather fast. This effect is sustainable over a period of >55 years under continuous agricultural production. The average car- (cid:0) 1 (Fig. 4A), bon gain in the topsoil removal trial was 28 Mg SOC ha which corresponds to a linearised annual C sequestration rate of about (cid:0) 1 over 55 years. This amount far exceeds 0.51 Mg SOC ha common C sequestration rates by, for example, intercropping (0.2 Mg (cid:0) 1; Cong et al. (2015)), or no tillage agriculture (<0.3 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1; Ogle et al. (2005); Paustian et al. (2019)). This amount SOC ha is also at the maximum of average SOC sequestration rates for SOC (cid:0) 1 sequestration promoting measures in agriculture (0.3–0.5 Mg SOC ha per year; Lal et al. (2015)) but at the lower end of SOC sequestration (cid:0) 1 per rates of reclaimed soils and after soil flipping (0.5–3.1 Mg SOC ha (cid:0) 1 per year; Kirschbaum year; Akala and Lal (2001); 0.4–0.7 Mg SOC ha et al. (2021) and Lawrence-Smith et al. (2021)) and lower than sequestration rates of grasslands after abandonment as arable land in the (cid:0) 1 per year; K¨ampf et al. (2016)). As temperate zone (0.75 Mg SOC ha most of this C likely originated from root debris and subsequent soil organic matter formation, our findings suggest a potential for C sequestration during the restoration of erosion-degraded, arable crop land. (cid:0) 1 year (cid:0) 1 year In an earlier study by Herzog (1984), the increase in C in the topsoil observed in our study had already been indicated. The author stated that after 11 years, the topsoil C concentration had tripled since the start of the experiment, already reaching 60–65 percent of the SOC concentra- tion of the control plot. Hence, this finding indicates that the largest part of the SOC content recovery occurred in the first 11 years and was completed within 26 years; or, in other words, that C sequestration rates in the first 11 years must have been around four times faster than in the subsequent years. In the years after the abandonment of the experiment, the topsoil SOC concentrations of the treatments no longer increased. Thus, the largest increase took place in the first 11 years, slowed down in the following 14 years, and between 1991 and 2019 the SOC concen- trations no longer changed. In those plots which received organic manure in the first 26 years the SOC contents declined due to the termination of organic manuring in 1991. The historical analyses and our comparison of 2019 total SOC and N stocks in the control treatment with topsoil removal and duplication showed similar results, we suggest that the overall analytical quality of current analyses is comparable to that performed before 1991; that is, both the gain in SOC as well as its loss observed in the organic fertilised trials is real. Changes in C sequestration rates have also been found in other studies. Guerrero et al. (2001) reported that, in particular, additions of compost to eroded and burnt soils were efficient in rapidly increasing SOC values within a year, even exceeding the control plot that had not lost any C. After a year, mineralisation rates in soil increased and the effect of the compost addition slowed down (Guerrero et al., 2001). A long-term study by Bl´ecourt et al. (2014) analysed the SOC recovery after topsoil removal and burial and showed that, after five years, SOC stocks started to recover and showed little difference to the controls after 44 years. This was because the exposed subsoil exhibited an increased capacity to store SOM formed from litter and root debris, which is similar to our study (Bl´ecourt et al., 2014). Analyses on fields with former deep-ploughing in Northern Germany also showed that increases in SOC stocks are possible on sandy soils, as the newly formed topsoils after deep ploughing showed enhanced accumulation of carbon (Alc´antara et al., 2016). Forty-five years after deep-ploughing, the SOC stocks in the whole profile of the deep-ploughed soils even exceeded those of the control plots, due to relocation of SOC from former topsoil into the new subsoil and respective re-accumulation of SOC in the topsoil (Alc´antara et al., 2016). Therefore, we may suggest that, in terms of total SOC storage, half a century is sufficient to build a sandy arable topsoil from former sandy subsoil. These effects result from bringing C- unsaturated subsoil material to the soil surface, which is the zone of highest C inputs by plants (roots, root exudates, crop residues), and from altered C cycling rates in the “new” topsoil. Most of the increase of the C stock of the topsoil removal trials was restricted to the topsoil. The subsoils of these treatments showed little if any gain in C stock, and differences in stocks were not significant, such as in the unfertilised treatments (Fig. 4A). In contrast to these findings, the topsoil duplication treatment showed an overall carbon loss, which mostly occurred from the current subsoil (the former Ap horizon), even though they had the highest overall SOC stocks of the treatments. Interestingly, this decrease in SOC stopped 25 years after the onset of the experiment (Fig. 2), showing linear behaviour in those 25 years (Fig. S4), but has non-linear behaviour over 55 years, similar to the increase in the new topsoil after removal. There was some C gain in the topsoil of both fertilised treatments but this was too small to compensate for the overall loss of subsoil C. Apparently, the high fertility of the surface soil promoted root growth mainly in the Ap horizon, so that the reduced root input to the relict A horizon promoted C loss, which is in support of our second hypothesis of this study. However, reduced root growth into the subsoil will also provide only low amounts of new labile C substrate to support further microbial mineralisation of organic mat- ter, which may explain the levelling-off of C losses over 55 years. Studies on SOC stocks in afforested areas provided similar results, where former arable soils with low concentration of organic matter showed increases in SOC stocks, while the soils that were already rich in organic matter showed a decrease or no change in SOC stocks after afforestation (Paul et al., 2002). Poeplau et al. (2011) found that reduced C input could increase decomposition of SOM, which can also happen by SOC burial in the case of soil flipping (Lawrence-Smith et al., 2021). However, this effect should be limited, while SOC sequestration is possible in buried soils when cropland receives the correct amount of N, P and S fertil- isation (Richardson et al., 2014). The increase in soil C stock in the topsoil removal and the loss in soil C in the topsoil duplication treatment to a level equal to the control plot is in line with the principle of soil carbon saturation. Six et al. (2002) outlined that several C stabilising mechanisms, such as aggregate formation, and sorption to clay particles, support C sequestration in soils. With increasing saturation of the mineral fraction, it is increasingly difficult to further increase SOC stocks by extra OM additions (Gulde et al., 2008). We investigated sandy soils, which have limited capacity to store carbon in aggregates or be adsorbed onto either clay particles or iron oxides and should therefore reach saturation rather quickly. The Luvisol at V210 showed very little variation in texture down to 60 cm, so the treatments could be easily compared with each other. Accordingly, in the topsoil removal treatments, the exposure of unsaturated subsoil material as new soil surface was initially susceptible to the different mechanisms of C stabilisation, but reached a steady-state equilibrium within 55 years. In contrast, the capacity of the former topsoil to retain C is limited. Under subsoil conditions of reduced root biomass input and without organic fertilisation, 50 percent of the former SOC was stabilised over decades. Nevertheless, even 32 years after the abandonment of the experiment, yields were still higher in this treatment (Fig. S5), but these yield gains did not result in additional C input and thus higher C stocks. The cumulative amount of C added with organic fertilisation was 1.1 tons during the experimental period of 1964 to 1991. This amount must be subtracted from the net amount of sequestered C. The treatments that received organic fertilisation overall sequestered less C than those that did not receive this material. Slow C saturation and aggregate forming mechanisms may add to this, as well as the priming processes outlined below. In any case, these data support recent discussions that organic Geoderma434(2023)11649211D.J. Burger et al. fertilisation must be considered with care when aiming for storing C in soil as a contribution to mitigating climate change (Amelung et al., 2020). Studying SOC storage and recovery in field experiments where the subsoil has been brought to the surface after topsoil removal or after soil flipping, in combination with topsoil burial, can give insights into C cycling and recovery of eroded landscapes (Bl´ecourt et al., 2014; Doet- terl et al., 2012; Harden et al., 1999; Lawrence-Smith et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2021). Soil erosion can be a carbon sink, when the loss of C at the eroded site is replaced and the C at the deposition site is stabilised (Berhe et al., 2018). Crops can provide a continuous input of C to eroded agricultural soils, thus rendering the soil a CO2 sink under adequate fertiliser application and tillage adapted to the site, which improves the soil’s C storage capacity (Berhe et al., 2007). The magnitude at which eroded soil is a sink depends on the scale and recovery or decomposition time (van Oost et al., 2007). Our data indicate that eroded sites are a C sink that fills within 26 years under good agricultural practice, at least for the sandy temperate soils under study. More importantly, however, the data imply that the respective soil loss is reversible; that is, there are means to restore soil C and the respective arable land with practices that are already well established in agriculture. 4.2. N co-dependency Already Harden et al. (1999) outlined that if the vegetation cover remains similar over time and the plot is fertilised, plant input will result in C sequestration (Harden et al., 1999). Here, we investigated different fertiliser treatments. The topsoils under different treatments all showed an increase in C stocks since the beginning of the experiment in 1964, which is partly caused by technological advancements in agriculture in Eastern Europe, hence a crop yield increase and thus C input during that time (Gervois et al., 2008). All treatments had similar C:N ratio in the topsoil, which supports the general assumption that C storage is co- dependent on N input (van Groenigen et al., 2017). The subsoils, in turn, exhibited variable C:N ratios, likely indicating that, with less pronounced C saturation, there is also limited control of N on total SOC storage. Higher subsoil C stocks in the two fertilised topsoil duplication treatments compared to the control correspond to early reports by Herzog (1984), who stated that 11 years after starting the experiment the subsoil C stock of the non-fertilised topsoil duplication treatment decreased. There are two likely reasons for this. On one hand, the lack of fertilisation reduced the yield and thereby reduced the above- and belowground C input needed for sequestering C (Amelung et al., 2020). On the other hand, N limitation in the non-fertilised treatments may promote OM losses, following the N mining theory according to which microorganisms increase SOM mineralisation in order to cover their N demand (Alc´antara et al., 2017; Craine et al., 2007; Meyer et al., 2017). Also, priming reactions by elevated inputs of labile C may add to faster decomposition rates due to increased microbial activity (Kuzyakov et al., 2000). Priming effects after inputs of labile C can be decreased by combining the labile C input with N fertilisation as well (Li et al., 2018). In either case, our data support Hypothesis 3 that N fertilisation is needed to maintain high levels of SOC. Changes in N stocks showed similar patterns as for the C stocks, with an increase in N stocks in the topsoil of the topsoil removal treatment, and a loss of N in the relict A horizons that are now subsoils of the topsoil duplication treatment (Fig. 4B). The gain in N was small in the fertilised topsoil duplication treatments, and relating this small gain in N to the cumulative amount of about 3 tons N added with fertilisation (Table 1) points to a severe N loss, likely mostly via harvest. 4.3. Aggregation Around 10 percent of the stored C in the soil was found in aggregates; therefore, the largest part of C storage cannot be explained by aggre- gation. Another 10 to 15 percent can be explained by labile pools such as POM. Hence, the majority of SOC was instead preserved by sorptive stabilisation at mineral surfaces (von Lützow et al., 2007; Wagai et al., 2009), for instance sand grains covered with oxides e.g. quartz (Regelink et al., 2015; Yeasmin et al., 2017; Wagai et al., 2020). This reflects a move away from steady-state equilibrium between in- and output as a key factor for C sequestration (Amelung et al., 2020). The differences in carbon stocks in aggregates between the treat- ments did not correspond to differences in bulk soil carbon stocks be- tween treatments. However, the topsoil removal treatment contained a similar amount of aggregates as the topsoil of the control plot. This finding points to complete recovery of soil structure, which has been reported to be already achieved within the first two decades after land- use change (K¨osters et al., 2013; Wick et al., 2009), and thus at a similar time-scale as that at which C sequestration may have been completed. In the experiment under study, there were no clear differences in the recovery of aggregate-bound C between the non-fertilised trials and those receiving combined organic and mineral fertilisers. This might point to an imbalance between the input of OM and biological activity, which was found by (Six et al., 2002), where each pool of C storage, such as the unprotected, physically protected and biochemically protected pool, will become saturated. All further C added will be stored in a less stable pool, and will become more subject to decomposition, as with decreasing stability the sensitivity to management and relevance as a nutrient source increases (Six et al., 2002; Stewart et al., 2007). Large inputs of OM may even destabilise aggregates (Doetterl et al., 2012; Stallard, 1998; VandenBygaart et al., 2012) at excessive amounts of POM (Six et al., 2002). Vice versa, particularly close to saturation of the soil mineral fraction, the capacity of the soil to include POM into mac- roaggregates plays an important role in carbon sequestration (Gulde et al., 2008; Poeplau et al., 2015). Here, the elevated C inputs (and thus also the elevated N inputs) did not promote the role of aggregates in overall C storage; this means we cannot fully support our fourth hy- pothesis that macroaggregate formation controlled C sequestration rates, as assumed from other studies (Blanco-Canqui & Lal, 2004). Obviously, this hypothesis does not apply universally for such sites as ours with coarse soil texture, reflecting that sandy soils generally exhibit low aggregate stability (Degens et al., 1996). More research might be needed to validate the processes for other sites. Notably, in other studies such as Alc´antara et al. (2016), where topsoils were mixed with subsoil material after deep-ploughing, sandy soils recovered slower than loamy soils within 50 years, since the sandy sites had a larger SOC deficit in the “new” topsoils than the loamy sites. However, this did not inhibit the restoration of fertile arable topsoil under good management practices. In addition, aggregate re-formation also restores of soil structure, which is important for soil hydraulic properties (Bronick & Lal, 2005). This plays a large role in root development, water and oxygen movement through soils and can also affect microorganisms, as well as lowering suscepti- bility to erosion (Barth`es & Roose, 2002; Bronick & Lal, 2005; Six et al., 2004), hence providing an overall improvement of soil fertility for agricultural purposes. Up to one-third of soils are degraded globally, largely by erosion (Montanarella et al., 2015), but even for extreme erosion events with complete topsoil loss, full restoration can be achieved at sites such as in our study. Soils with a sand content like our site or higher comprise 26.5% of German agricultural soils, and around one fifth of European agricultural land, but store relatively little carbon, although having high variation (European Commission, Joint Research Centre, 2013; Huang & Hartemink, 2020; Poeplau et al., 2020). In order to better understand the mechanisms behind C sequestration in sandy soils and the influence of different C management practises (Huang & Hartemink, 2020), future works should now comprise long term field studies on C cycling of eroded soils in different landscapes and different climates (Doetterl et al., 2016). Not only for modelling the interplay of erosion and C cycling across larger scales (Doetterl et al., 2016), but particularly for restoring degraded land by common agricultural practice. Supporting economic incentives will re-increase yields and C returns into these sites. Geoderma434(2023)11649212D.J. Burger et al. Furthermore, our results support new tillage systems, such as fractional deep tillage, to achieve a long-term increase in SOC stocks and soil fertility at arable lands. 5. Conclusion After 26 years, the topsoil SOC stocks in the topsoil removal treatments had reached similar values as in the other treatments. This new topsoil had not only reformed aggregates and re-sequestered SOC, but its properties overall now sustain yields at a similar level as in the surrounding sites. This finding gives hope as it demonstrates, for the first time, that even at heavily eroded sites it is possible to restore topsoil properties completely, after putting measures in place preventing further recurring erosion. For the sandy sites studied here, this restoration is achieved even within a few decades simply by managing these soils at good agricultural practice, using less mineral- and more organic fertiliser. In the treatment with topsoil duplication, improved soil fertility, total C stocks and also yield were even maintained after 55 years depending on the fertilisation input and were higher than the control plot. When former topsoil was buried below current plough layer, it lost only 30–50 percent of its SOC, depending on the fertiliser regime. The degree to which former topsoil carbon stocks could be maintained depended on initial N input, with higher initial N status preserving more SOC of the former topsoil material in current subsoil. In the topsoils, by contrast, no legacy of different N fertilisation levels remained; higher N fertilisation rates did not result in elevated N storage. The results have implications for our further management as they indicate that it is possible to restore the full amount of former topsoil SOC losses when nutrient losses are replaced by fertilisation. Agricul- tural management has been responsible for large amounts of recent SOC losses, but management is needed again to revert them within reason- able time-scales, rather than pure nature based-solutions that would convert the land back to native ecosystems without accounting for former nutrient losses.
