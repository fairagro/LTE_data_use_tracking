	abstract = {Erosion of fertile topsoil means severe land degradation and yield loss. Here, we show that reformation of the fertile topsoil and crop yield increase is possible by good agricultural management within a few decades. Evidence relies on a unique long-term field experiment in NE Germany, where in 1964 the sandy soil (Luvisol) had been excavated to 52 cm and refilled with subsoil material of 52 cm thickness. Undisturbed trials served as controls, these were all combined with either no fertilisation, mineral fertilisation or a combined mineral and organic fertilisation. It took only 26 years until new topsoil had been formed. Its soil organic carbon (SOC) and total N stocks and the aggregate size distributions equalled that of the other treatments; SOC sequestration corresponded to 28 Mg SOC ha−1. The former topsoil buried below the plough layer lost 30–50 percent of its SOC during 5 decades in a non-linear manner. We conclude that our current agricultural tools can restore degraded arable land rather fast and contribute to climate change mitigation through a significant SOC sequestration as well.},

	abstract = {CONTEXT: Long-Term Field Experiments (LTEs) were implemented to study the long-term effects of different management practices, including tillage, fertilization and crop rotation under otherwise constant conditions. Climate change is expected to change these conditions, challenging interpretation of LTE data with regard to the distinction between climate change and management effects.
OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to quantify the expected, spatially differentiated changes of agroclimatic conditions for the German LTE sites as a precondition for modelling and LTE data interpretation.
METHODS: We developed a framework combining spatially distributed climate data and LTE metadata to identify the possible climatic changes at 247 LTE sites with experiments running for 20 years or more. The LTEs were classified using the following categories: fertilization, tillage, crop rotation, field crops or grassland, conventional or organic. We utilized climate variables (temperature, precipitation) and agroclimatic indicators (aridity, growing degree days, etc.) to compare a baseline (1971–2000) with future periods (2021-2100) under the IPCC’s Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP). A comprehensive LTE risk assessment was conducted, based on changes in climate variables and agroclimatic indicators between baseline and future scenarios.
RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Under the most extreme scenario (SSP585), 150 LTEs are expected to shift from humid and dry sub-humid to semi-arid conditions. Frost days in LTE areas are expected to decline by 81\%, andthe growing season to lengthen by up to 92\%. The spatial differentiation of expected climate change also facilitates the identification of suitable sites for future agricultural practices and may inform the design of new LTEs.
SIGNIFICANCE: Our results may guide the interpretation of LTE data regarding the effect of climate change, facilitating future soil crop modelling studies with LTE data and providing information for planning new LTE sites to support future agricultural research and/or adapting management on existing LTE sites. The framework we developed can easily be transferred to LTE sites in agricultural regions worldwide to support LTE research on climate change impacts and adaptation.},

Metadata collected included precise descriptions of the treatments (combination of factors such as tillage, crop type/rotation, amendments/fertilizers, grazing and pest/weed management), soil and crop measurements and pedo‐climatic information. Using different figures and dashboards, an overview of those MTEs/LTEs is presented and specific research themes (tillage systems, residue management, amendment type and cover crops) are further analysed within their pedo‐climatic context. An interactive web portal developed in collaboration with the BonaRes project (

Finally, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the metadataset was carried out to highlight the potential contribution of MTEs/LTEs to a harmonized European soil observation and monitoring approach. We propose that the metadataset could be elaborated with metadata from other existing MTEs/LTEs in Europe or even worldwide.},

	abstract = {Crop production often leads to soil organic carbon (SOC) losses. However, under good management practice it is possible to maintain and even re-accumulate SOC. We evaluated how different cropland management techniques affected SOC stocks in the topsoil (0–30 cm depth) of 10 long-term experiments (LTE) in Germany. We found that SOC stocks were particularly enhanced by mineral fertilization and organic amendments like straw incorporation and to a smaller degree by irrigation, but only slightly affected by the choice of preceding crops. In agreement with global meta-analyses, liming and reduced tillage had little or even negative effects on SOC storage, but effects also depended on fertilization. Management effects on SOC stocks were dependent on soil texture: sandy soils showed the lowest SOC stocks of 20.9 ± 2.3 (standard error of the mean) Mg ha−1, but exhibited the largest relative response to different management options. Annual changes in SOC stocks ranged from −3.0 ‰ with no mineral N fertilization, to + 6.1 ‰ with farmyard manure application, using the mineral-fertilized and limed treatment as reference. Even higher rates of up to + 10.6 ‰ yr−1 were reached with the combination of irrigation and straw incorporation. Note that the contribution of organic amendments to SOC accrual and thus to climate change mitigation must be adjusted for reduction in SOC at sites from which straw was removed. Overall, the potential of agricultural management to influence and enhance SOC stocks is significant. This potential is controlled by soil type and land-use duration, is largest for sandy soils with overall lowest SOC stocks, and is characterized by antagonistic and synergistic effects of different management practices.},

	abstract = {Long‐term experiments (LTEs) have provided data to modellers and agronomists to investigate changes and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different cropping systems. As treatment changes have occurred due to agricultural advancements, so too have analytical soil methods. This may lead to method bias over time, which could affect the robust interpretation of data and conclusions drawn. This study aims to quantify differences in SOC due to changes in dry combustion methods over time, using soil samples of a LTE established in 1963 that focuses on mineral and organic fertilizer management in the temperate zone of Northeast Germany. For this purpose, 1059 soil samples, collected between 1976 and 2008, have been analysed twice, once with their historical laboratory method right after sampling, and a second time in 2016 when all samples were analysed using the same elementary analyser. In 9 of 11 soil sampling campaigns, a paired
                t
                ‐test provided evidence for significant differences in the historical SOC values when compared with the re‐analysed concentrations of the same LTE sample. In the sampling years 1988 and 2004, the historical analysis obtained about 0.9 g kg
                −1
                lower SOC compared with the re‐analysed one. For 1990 and 1998, this difference was about 0.4 g kg
                −1
                . Correction factors, an approach often used to correct for different analytical techniques, could only be applied for 5 of 11 sampling campaigns to account for constant and proportional systematic method error. For this particular LTE, the interpretation of SOC changes due to agronomic management (here fertilization) deviates depending on the analytical method used, which may weaken the explanatory power of the historical data. We demonstrate that analytical method changes over time present one of many challenges in the interpretation of time series data of SOC dynamics. Therefore, LTE site managers need to ensure providing all necessary protocols and data in order to retrace method changes and if necessary recalculate SOC.

	abstract = {Agricultural management can influence soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks and thus may contribute to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The soil depth to which agricultural management practices affect SOC is uncertain. Soil depth may have an important bearing on soil carbon dynamics, so it is important to consider depth effects to capture fully changes in SOC stocks. This applies in particular to the evaluation of carbon farming measures, which are becoming increasingly important due to climate change. We sampled and analysed the upper metre of mineral cropland soils from ten long-term experiments (LTEs) in Germany to quantify depth-specific effects on SOC stocks of common agricultural management practices: mineral nitrogen (N) fertilisation, a combination of N, phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) fertilisation, irrigation, a crop rotation with preceding crops (pre-crops), straw incorporation, application of farmyard manure (FYM), liming, and reduced tillage. In addition, the effects of soil compaction on SOC stocks were examined as a negative side effect of agricultural management. Results showed that 19 ± 3 \% of total management effects on SOC stocks were found in the upper subsoil (30–50 cm) and 3 ± 4 \% in the lower subsoil (50–100 cm), including all agricultural management practices with significant topsoil SOC effects, while 79 ± 7 \% of management effects were in the topsoil (0–30 cm). Nitrogen and NPK fertilisation were the treatments that had the greatest effect on subsoil organic carbon (OC) stocks, followed by irrigation, FYM application and straw incorporation. Sampling down to a depth of 50 cm resulted in significantly higher SOC effects than when considering topsoil only. A crop rotation with pre-crops, liming, reduced tillage and soil compaction did not significantly affect SOC stocks at any depth increment. Since approximately 20 \% of the impact of agricultural management on SOC stocks occurs in the subsoil, we recommend soil monitoring programs and carbon farming schemes extend their standard soil sampling down to 50 cm depth to capture fully agricultural management effects on SOC.},

	abstract = {Long-term fertilizer experiments (LTFEs) are essential for agricultural research as they provide necessary information and data to build predictive models. These models can be used to estimate future plant growth under different climate and management scenarios to support decision-making processes. The current study analyzed cereal grain yield responses to fertilizer management in sandy soil in a LTFE (1971 to 2016) in Northeast Germany. The objectives of this study were to a) analyze yield responses of spring barley), winter rye, and winter wheat to fertilizer management, b) analyze the sensitivity of yield responses to timing of weather events, and c) compare different analysis models. The study revealed that cereal yield response to fertilizer management was influenced by complex relationships among climatic dependence, preceding crop, and soil characteristics. Weather conditions at seeding and early growth stages of cereal were found to be sensitive to grain yield. For winter cereals, the intensity and duration of extreme temperatures in the summertime (harvest year), especially the number of days recorded with a maximum temperature above 30°C in July was an important variable for the yield. Among the investigated models, LMM-model had a better predictive performance compared to M5P-model and both had richer regressors than the ANOVA and BMA-model. The M5P-model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM-model. The findings of this analysis contribute to comprehensive strategies for sustainable crop production with regard to future climate change.},

                stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water‐related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing

	abstract = {Due to the fact that silicon (Si) increases the resistance of plants against diverse abiotic and biotic stresses, Si nowadays is categorized as beneficial substance for plants. However, humans directly influence Si cycling on a global scale. Intensified agriculture and corresponding harvest-related Si exports lead to Si losses in agricultural soils. This anthropogenic desilication might be a big challenge for modern agriculture. However, there is still only little knowledge about Si cycling in agricultural systems of the temperate zone, because most studies focus on rice and sugarcane production in (sub)tropical areas. Furthermore, many studies are performed for a short term only, and thus do not provide the opportunity to analyze slow changes in soil–plant systems (e.g., desilication) over long periods. We analyzed soil and plant samples from an ongoing long-term field experiment (established 1963) in the temperate zone (NE Germany) to evaluate the effects of different nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium (NPK) fertilization rates and crop straw recycling (i.e., straw incorporation) on anthropogenic desilication in the long term. Our results clearly show that crop straw recycling not only prevents anthropogenic desilication (about 43–60\% of Si exports can be saved by crop straw recycling in the long term), but also replenishes plant available Si stocks of agricultural soil–plant systems. Furthermore, we found that a reduction of N fertilization rates of about 69\% is possible without considerable biomass losses. This economy of the need for N fertilizers potentially can be combined with the benefits of crop straw recycling, i.e., enhancement of carbon sequestration via straw inputs and prevention of anthropogenic desilication of agricultural soil–plant systems. Thus crop straw recycling might have the potential to act as key management practice in sustainable, low fertilization agriculture in the temperate zone in the future.},

In this study, we combined a 120‐day incubation experiment with thermal decay dynamics of agricultural soils altered by added organic amendments. The aim was to determine the abilities and limits of thermal analysis as a rapid approach revealing differences in the degradability of SOM. The carried out experiments based on two independent sampling sets. The first sample set consisted of soil samples taken from non‐fertilized plots of three German long‐term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs), then artificially mixed with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal equal to 60 Mg ha
              −1
              under laboratory conditions. The second sample set based on soil samples of different treatments (
              e.g
              ., crop type, fertilization, cultivation) in LTAEs at Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg, Germany. Before and after the incubation experiment, thermal mass losses (TML) at selected temperatures were determined by thermogravimetry indicating the degradability of organic amendments mixed in soils. The results confirmed different microbial degradability of organic amendments and SOM under laboratory conditions. Thermal decay dynamics revealed incubation‐induced changes in the artificial soil mixtures primarily at TML around 300°C in the case of applied straw and sheep faeces, whereas farmyard manure showed mainly changes in TML around 450°C. Charcoal did not show significant degradation during incubation, which was confirmed by TML. Detailed analyses of the artificial soil mixtures revealed close correlations between CO

We conclude that the practical assessment of SOM could be facilitated by thermal decay dynamics if modified sample preparation and evaluation algorithms are used beyond traditional peak analysis.},

In our study, we analyzed soil hydrological conditions at three agricultural experimental field plots with sandy soils and different crop rotations using a 22-year period from 1993 to 2014 with daily volumetric soil water contents measured by the Time Domain Reflectometry with Intelligent MicroElements (TRIME)-method and pressure heads determined by automatic recording tensiometers. These measured data were compared with soil water contents and pressure heads simulated by a process-based agroecosystem model. Within this 22-year period, time spans with a better model performance and periods with a lower goodness of fit between simulations and observations were observed. The lower goodness of fit in the summer periods was attributed to inadequate calculations of root water uptake. Measurement errors of the TRIME-probes and differences between soil water contents measured by TRIME and pressure heads observed by tensiometers due to different measurement volumes, precision and measuring principles were identified as further reasons for mismatches between simulated and measured model outputs.},

	abstract = {Sustainable soil management requires reliable and accurate monitoring of changes in soil organic matter (SOM). However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non‐fertilized plots of three German long‐term agricultural experiments in Bad Lauchstädt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Müncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha
              −1
              each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha
              −1
              or 0.1–0.4 g C kg
              −1
              soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amendments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330°C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520°C. Furthermore, differences between measured (with TML
              110–550
              ) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML
              330
              ) and clay contents (with TML
              140
              ) were confirmed as a suitable indicator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermogravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen (N) supply from organic amendments [such as farmyard manure (FYM), slurries or crop residues] to crops is commonly expressed in the amendment’s Nitrogen Fertiliser Replacement Value (NFRV). Values for NFRV can be determined by comparison of crop yield or N uptake in amended plots against mineral fertiliser-only plots. NFRV is then defined as the amount of mineral fertiliser N saved when using organic amendment-N (kg/kg), while attaining the same crop yield. Factors known to affect NFRV are crop type cultivated, soil type, manuring history and method or time of application. We investigated whether long-term NFRV depends on N application rates. Using data from eight long term experiments in Europe, values of NFRV at low total N supply were compared with values of NFRV at high total N supply. Our findings show that FYM has a significant higher NFRV value at high total N supply than at low total N supply (1.12 vs. 0.53, p = 0.04). For the other amendment types investigated, NFRV was also higher at high total N supply than at low total N supply, but sample sizes were too small or variations too large to detect significant differences. Farmers in Europe usually operate at high rates of total N applied. If fertiliser supplements are based on NFRV of the manure estimated at low total N supply, N fertiliser requirements might be overestimated. This might lead to overuse of N, lower N use efficiency and larger losses of N to the environment.},

	abstract = {In undulating landscapes erosion is largely responsible for the spatial distribution of C stocks in agricultural soils. Whether these stocks contribute to global atmospheric CO2 concentrations as source or sink of CO2 is under constant debate. Periodic CO2 measurements were carried out at a hummocky ground moraine site grown with maize, fodder rye and sorghum using dynamic non-steady-state transparent and opaque chambers. Flux calculation for CO2 was conducted using the empirical gap-filling model of Hoffmann et al. (2015b), which uses temperature and radiation to simulate ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP) and to calculate net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE). This model was compared with a process-based agro-ecosystem simulation model, MONICA, which was tested for its ability to simulate Reco, GPP and NEE, using the empirical model as benchmark. Both models simulated GPP and Reco in the same order of magnitude, with MONICA simulating a considerably higher amount of CO2 produced by photosynthesis for maize and less deviating CO2 produced by photosynthesis for the other crops and CO2 consumed by respiration for all crops as compared to the empirical model. Both models largely agree in CO2 flux patterns, but show considerable differences directly after harvest and during bare soil periods. Strengths and weaknesses of both approaches were discussed and synergies of applying both approaches in conjunction were identified in a way that (i) MONICA may act as an independent method to identify significant deviations from the optimum crop growth pattern and thus point at times during which assumptions of the empirical model for simulating NEE may be violated and that (ii) the empirical model may act as a calibration benchmark for MONICA flux simulations.},

A suitable possibility for this quantification is the analysis of long-term field experiments, because the carbon and nitrogen contents are continuously measured on those sites, according to the principle of ceteris paribus, over long periods often comprising several decades. For the present study, the results of 15 long-term field experiments on ten different sites with 150 different variations of fertilization were evaluated. The duration of the experiments was between 40 and 110 years (with one exception). The data of the Corg-contents were studied almost complete within a period of 20 years while the contents of Nt were considered within six experiments. The results of the 15 long-term field experiments reveal that on all variants with combined organic-mineral fertilization in the order of magnitude according to the “best practice” and the “method of balance of humus”, no depletion of the Corg-contents was detected. Instead, we found a significant increase in various cases. Also in the case of the Nt-contents, no depletion could be detected. A large number of analyses and studies dealing with long-term field experiments of other authors support those results.},

All unfertilized treatments are depleted in soil organic carbon (SOC), varying between 0.36 and 2.06\% SOC. The differences in SOC in unfertilized plots compared with the respective plots with combined mineral (NPK) and organic (10 t ha−1 farmyard manure) fertilization range between 0.11 and 0.72\%, with an average of 0.3\% (corresponding to ∼15 t ha−1).

	abstract = {Phosphorus (P) is an essential major plant nutrient and P fertilization is an indispensable 
measure to satisfy the P demand of agricultural crops. Phosphate rock is the main raw 
material used for industrial mineral fertilizer production. Uranium (U) concentrations 
are extremely variable and in some cases extraordinarily high in rock phosphates (Kratz 
et al. 2008; Papastefanou et al. 2006; Righi et al. 2004). Since U is a trace element, 
which is known for its radiological and chemical toxicity (Busby \& Schnug 2008), it is 
important to evaluate the extent to which U applied by mineral P fertilization will 
accumulate in soils over time. Soil properties that affect U mobility include parent 
material, weathering, water saturation, soil organic carbon content, pH, cation exchange 
capacity, soil texture, and particularly clay content (CCME 2007). It is known that U 
does not migrate substantially in soils with higher clay and soil organic matter contents 
compared to sandy soils (Sheppard et al. 1984). Several long-term field studies showed 
that surface soils, which received regularly mineral P fertilization contained higher U 
concentrations than unfertilized soils (Jones 1992; Rothbaum et al. 1979; Takeda et al. 
2005, 2006; Taylor and Kim 2008). 
 It is the aim of this chapter to determine the fertilizer-based U accumulation in soils 
in relation to P rate, fertilizer product and soil characteristics on the basis of long-term 
field experiments in Germany. In the first section U concentrations in soil samples of 
different experimental sites and treatments are compared. In the second section a site-specific risk assessment of U contamination of arable soils by P-containing mineral and 
organic fertilizers will be carried out.},

	abstract = {The use of integrated soil organic matter (SOM) models to assess SOM dynamics under climate change, land use change and different land management practices require a quantification of uncertainties and key sensitive factors related to the respective modelling framework. Most uncertainty studies hereby focus on model parameter uncertainty, neglecting other sources like input data derived uncertainties, and spatial and temporal properties of uncertainty. Sources of uncertainties assessed in this study stem from uncertainties in model parameterisation and from uncertainties in model input data (climate, soil data, and land management assumptions). Thereby, Monte Carlo based global sensitivity and uncertainty analysis using a latin hypercube stratified sampling technique was applied to derive plot scale (focusing on temporal propagation) and river basin scale propagation of uncertainty for long-term soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics. The model used is the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model), which has been extended by a process-based multi-compartment model for SOM turnover. Results obtained by this study can be transferred and used in other simulation models of this kind. Uncertainties resulting from all input factors used (model parameters+model input data) show a coefficient of variation between 5.1 and 6.7\% and accounted for+/-0.065 to+/-0.3\% soil carbon content (0.06-0.15t Cha{\textasciicircum}-{\textasciicircum}1yr{\textasciicircum}-{\textasciicircum}1). Parameter derived uncertainty contributed most to overall uncertainty. Concerning input data contributions, uncertainties stemming from soil and climate input data variations are striking. At the river basin scale, cropland and forest ecosystems, loess and gleyic soils possess the highest degree of uncertainty. Quantified magnitudes of uncertainty stemming from the examined sources vary temporally and spatially due to specific natural settings (e.g. climate, land use and soil properties) and deliver useful information for interpreting simulation results on long-term soil organic carbon dynamics under environmental change. Derived from this analysis, key sensitive model parameters and interactions between them were identified: the mineralization rate coefficient, the carbon use efficiency parameter (synthesis coefficient) along with parameters determining the soil temperature influence on SOM turnover (mainly Q10 value) and the soil input related data (soil bulk density and initial soil C content) introduced the highest degree of model uncertainty. The here gained information can be transferred to other process-based SOM turnover models to consider stronger most crucial parameters introducing highest uncertainty contribution to soil C storage assessment under changing environmental conditions.},

	abstract = {A process-based extension of the eco-hydrological river basin model SWIM (Soil and Water Integrated Model) to simulate selected environmental change impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) dynamics for environmental conditions in meso- to macro-scale river basins is proposed. The novel aspect and main advantage of the extended model is an integrated consideration of hydrological processes, vegetation dynamics and biogeochemical cycles (soil carbon, phosphorus, and nitrogen) in semi-closed systems (river basins) under environmental change.
Thereby the extension was designed to integrate present-day understanding of soil organic matter dynamics under the constraints of data availability for parameterisation at the regional scale. A major advantage is less data and parameter necessary to run the model compared to state of the art SOC models and the availability of direct measurements of soil C carbon contents to test and validate the model.
The model extension was tested regarding primary organic matter decomposition and long-term SOC dynamics using observed data sets. This test delivered similar quality as other SOC models. The new SOC model extension adequately represents these processes when compared to observed data on experimental field sites and literature studies.
Application of the extended model to assess impacts of land management practices (different organic and inorganic fertilisation schemes, different crop rotations, inclusion of cover crops and harvest by-product returns) on long-term SOC dynamics is presented here at the experimental field and river basin scale.
The simulated quantification at the field scale of different fertilisation regimes led to changes from −0.13 to +0.1 t C ha−1 year−1 in SOC, different types of crop rotations and cover crop impacts changed SOC between −0.13 and +0.07 t C ha−1 year−1 and incorporation of harvest by-products (grain straw residuals) led to changes between −0.1 and +0.027 t C ha−1 year−1 in SOC.
It is shown on the river basin scale that harvest by-products quantity remaining on the field significantly impact regional SOC dynamics (loss of 0.26 t C ha−1 year−1 when exporting all harvest by-products). The modelled results are in general agreement with studies reported in literature.
The extended model is hence able to quantify the impacts of selected land management practices on long-term SOC dynamics and allows land management practices and their impacts on water availability, water quality, carbon storage in soils, and vegetation growth to be assessed in an integrated way.},

	abstract = {Almost all soil organic carbon turnover models rely on a partitioning of total organic carbon into an inert and a decomposable pool. The quantification of these pools has a large impact on modelling results. In this study several methods to estimate inert carbon in soils, based either on total soil organic matter or physical protection, were assessed with the objectives of (1) minimising errors in carbon and nitrogen dynamics and (2) ensuring usability for sites with marked differences in site conditions. CANDY simulations were carried out by varying solely the method for calculating the size of the inert carbon pool used to initialise the model. Experimental data from Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg were used for the simulation. The data were made available for modellers at a workshop held at Müncheberg (Germany) in 2004. The results concerning not only carbon but also nitrogen dynamics were analysed by applying selected statistical methods. It was shown that even in short-term simulations model initialisation procedure may influence the simulation results considerably. Three methods of estimating inert carbon were identified as being the most appropriate. These methods are either based on soil texture or pore-space classes and therefore account for the physical protection of soil organic matter. Thus, physical protection seems to be of major importance. By extending the scope of the investigation into nitrogen dynamics, additional support for the applicability of a selected method was obtained.},

              The composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is influenced by land use and fertilization. We studied changes in the SOM in a long‐term field experiment on a sandy Podzoluvisol. The control plot and four combinations of manurial treatments of the experiment were selected: one with mineral fertilizer only and three combinations of organic manure with mineral fertilizer: cattle manure + NPK, cattle manure + PK and straw + NPK. The SOM was extracted by sodium pyrophosphate solution (pH = 10) and hot water (100°C). The extracts were analysed by Fourier‐Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The FT‐IR spectra from sodium pyrophosphate extracts indicate that composition of SOM is indeed influenced by different fertilization. The C=O band at 1710 cm
              –1
              in the samples of the plots fertilized with cattle manure has the highest absorption intensity, whereas the material from the plot fertilized with straw + NPK has the least intense. The GPC analyses of the extracts showed that adding cattle manure + NPK increased the molecular size of SOM in comparison with the control plot. The analysis of hot‐water extracts with FT‐IR showed no significant differences in functional groups, but GPC chromatograms distinguished features in molecular size distribution. Fertilization with cattle manure increased the molecular size of the SOM in comparison with the control, but the differences in content of carboxylic groups and molecular weight were detected in sodium pyrophosphate extracts only.},

Both C and N in SOM have to be divided into an inert and a decomposable fraction. The inert C is strongly correlated with clay content, while most changes in both C and N occur in the readily decomposable fraction.

              Soil organic matter (SOM) can be affected by adopted soil management options. However, it is unclear how mineral and organic fertilization could change the amount and composition of SOM. The objective of this study was to test the applicability of infrared spectroscopy for analyzing management‐induced impacts on organic matter (OM) composition. Ap horizon samples were collected from the long term‐field experiments at Bad Lauchstädt (loam), Groß Kreutz, and Müncheberg (both loamy sand) in plots fertilized with farmyard manure (FYM), farmyard manure plus mineral N (FYM + N), and mineral N only (N) and an unfertilized control plot. The SOM and hot‐water‐soluble and pyrophosphate‐soluble (OM‐PY) organic matter fractions were analyzed using Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The OM composition was evaluated in terms of the ratio between absorption band intensities in FTIR. The soluble OM fractions of FYM had larger C=O/C–O–C ratios than the N and control treatments. While the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of OM‐PY from FYM was larger, it was smaller for the N plots than the control at all sites. The results allowed identification of fertilization‐induced long‐term dynamics in (i) the OM composition and (ii) the CEC and the potential wettability of SOM and OM fractions. The OM‐PY fraction could be used to identify and characterize the long‐term changes in OM composition. For a more quantitative analysis, however, more replicate samples and a seasonal differentiation would be required to separate between shorter and longer term changes.},

The investigations were focused on: effects of land use changes on the fate of soil organic carbon; options of agronomic practices to maintain or to increase soil organic carbon; relationships between organic fertilization and changes in soil organic carbon. The long-term observations showed that the amount of soil organic matter is primarily a function of the prevailing land use. Clearly marked differences were observed between long-term arable farming with lower and short-term with higher soil organic carbon content. Agricultural practices lead to a decrease of soil organic carbon with the result that arable soils are rather sources of carbon than sinks. The carbon sequestration potential is caused by the agronomic management to different extents. The combination of organic and mineral fertilization increased the soil organic carbon content compared to exclusive mineral fertilization. Optimum values of organic fertilizer application for maintaining soil organic carbon were calculated. Liming reduced the soil carbon pool when applied in large amounts. Long-term fertilization experiments are a useful tool for calculating the carbon sink or source potential of arable soils.},

Type of air pollutants, deposition rate and structure of ecosystem bias the effects on agriculture. Increased CO2 concentrations generally cause positive effects through increased root mass, litter and crop residues thereby increasing soil organic matter and plant growth. Accelerated CO2 concentrations are associated with higher temperatures causing negative effects on soils. The reduction of SO2 emissions has a major effect on the productivity of agricultural crops (yield losses, reduced natural resistance, increased non-point N losses, increase of surface ozone concentration). N depositions contribute indirectly to N2O emission through an increased amount of N in the nutrient balance. Deposition of ammonia compounds is a primary cause of soil acidification. Ammonia contributes to transboundary air pollution and nitrogen enrichment of nutrient-poor soils. Air pollutants affect agriculture and may endanger a sustainable crop production. This is inconsistent with the requirement to protect the natural resources soil, water, atmosphere, and energy.},

The presentations and discussions focused on understanding the activities and advantages in publishing and using LTE data, including, i) LTE data management and reuse through the LTE overview map (lte.bonares.de) and the BonaRes Repository in which an increasingly large number of LTE research data are offered for free reuse, ii) use of structured LTE data for model applications, iii) research on soil management with LTE. The importance of up-to-date LTE standards, the requirements for data acquisition and the statistical analysis of LTEs were concluded. The outcomes emphasized the paramount importance of LTE in understanding management and climate change impacts in agriculture. A close collaboration between leading LTE groups (BonaRes, EJP SOIL, GLTEN) was concluded as relevant to increase the visibility of LTEs for boosting European research initiatives in soil research. A position document about the future need for LTE sites, management, and data analysis is envisaged as the next step.},

SB yields were significantly affected by fertilisation regimes (11\%), annual weather conditions (55\%) and their interaction effect (8\%). Mineral N fertilization decreased overall yield variability across seasons as compared to no fertilization and organic fertilization regimes showed higher yield variability. A suitable combined application of mineral nitrogen and organic fertiliser was found to be an effective way to produce higher SB yields than the application of either mineral nitrogen or organic fertiliser alone. A Bayesian linear regression model showed total precipitation during the growing season (April–July) positively affected on SB yields when high mineral N was supplied. At the early growth stage, a precipitation rate (March) and temperature (April or sowing day) negatively affected on SB yield.},

	abstract = {To compare how different analytical methods explain crop yields from a long-term field experiment (LTFE), we analyzed the grain yield of winter wheat (WW) under different fertilizer applications in Müncheberg, Germany. An analysis of variance (ANOVA), linear mixed-effects model (LMM), and MP5 regression tree model were used to evaluate the grain yield response. All the methods identified fertilizer application and environmental factors as the main variables that explained 80\% of the variance in grain yields. Mineral nitrogen fertilizer (NF) application was the major factor that influenced the grain yield in all methods. Farmyard manure slightly influenced the grain yield with no NF application in the ANOVA and M5P regression tree. While sources of environmental factors were unmeasured in the ANOVA test, they were quantified in detail in the LMM and M5P model. The LMM and M5P model identified the cumulative number of freezing days in December as the main climate-based determinant of the grain yield variation. Additionally, the temperature in October, the cumulative number of freezing days in February, the yield of the preceding crop, and the total nitrogen in the soil were determinants of the grain yield in both models. Apart from the common determinants that appeared in both models, the LMM additionally showed precipitation in June and the cumulative number of days in July with temperatures above 30 °C, while the M5P model showed soil organic carbon as an influencing factor of the grain yield. The ANOVA results provide only the main factors affecting the WW yield. The LMM had a better predictive performance compared to the M5P, with smaller root mean square and mean absolute errors. However, they were richer regressors than the ANOVA. The M5P model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM model. Hence, the use of different methods can strengthen the statement of the analysis, and thus, the co-use of the LMM and M5P model should be considered, especially in large databases involving multiple variables.},

	abstract = {Abstract. The collective analysis of long-term field experiments (LTFEs), here defined as agricultural
experiments with a minimum duration of 20 years and research in the context of sustainable
soil use and yield, can be used for detecting changes in soil properties and yield such as those induced
by climate change. However, information about existing LTFEs is scattered, and the research data
are not easily accessible. In this study, meta-information on LTFEs in Germany is compiled and
their spatial representation is analyzed. The study is conducted within the framework of the
BonaRes project, which, inter alia, has established a central access point for LTFE information
and research data. A total of 205 LTFEs which fit to the definition above are identified. Of these,
140 LTFEs are ongoing. The land use in 168 LTFEs is arable field crops, in 34 trials grassland, in
2 trials vegetables and in 1 trial pomiculture. Field crop LTFEs are categorized into
fertilization (n=158), tillage (n=38) and crop rotation (n=32; multiple nominations
possible) experiments, while all grassland experiments (n=34) deal with fertilization. The
spatial representation is analyzed according to the climatic water balance of the growing season
(1 May to 31 October) (CWBg), the Müncheberg Soil Quality Rating (MSQR) and clay content. The
results show that, in general, the LTFEs well represent the area shares of both the CWBg and the
MSQR classes. Eighty-nine percent of the arable land and 65 \% of the grassland in Germany are covered by
the three driest CWBg classes, hosting 89 \% and 71 \% of the arable and grassland LTFEs,
respectively. LTFEs cover all six MSQR classes but with a bias towards the high and very high
soil quality classes. LTFEs on arable land are present in all clay content classes according to
the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) but with a bias towards the clay content class 4. Grassland LTFEs show a bias towards
the clay content classes 5, 6 and 7, while well representing the other clay content classes,
except clay content class 3, where grassland LTFEs are completely missing. The results confirm
the very high potential of LTFE data for spatially differentiated analyses and modeling.
However, reuse is restricted by the difficult access to LTFE research data. The common database
is an important step in overcoming this restriction.},

	abstract = {Agricultural long-term experiments (LTEs) are most valuable research infrastructures to reveal the effects of agricultural measures in the long run. However, information about existing LTEs is scattered and the data are often not easy to access. A repository for LTE data and metadata can ensure that a particular LTE can be found easily and access to the data is simplified.
“BonaRes” is short for “Soil as a Sustainable Resource for the Bioeconomy.” In this funding initiative of the German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) one focus is on the acquisition, storage, and provision of data from LTEs in Germany and beyond. For better findability and reusability of these data, the BonaRes Data Repository was established. The BonaRes Data Portal is an important component, which serves as a central access point for data managed within the BonaRes Data Repository. It aims at providing information about LTEs in Germany as well as LTEs' research data for free reuse.
The definition of LTE in the context of BonaRes is a minimum duration of 20 years, a static design and focus on a scientific issue in the context of soil and yield. According to this definition, in total 200 LTEs across Germany were identified. Information was compiled and published in a dynamic GIS-based web application.
Research data in the BonaRes Data Repository will be provided according to the FAIR principles. Standards are an important component of this concept. The BonaRes Data Centre compiled, discussed, and published a list of more than 600 standards, regulations, code lists, and controlled vocabularies in the field of soil, agricultural, and data science.
Before research data are transferred to the BonaRes Data Repository, the appropriate data policy must be approved by the respective institution's head on behalf of the responsible institution. Metadata has to be provided to ensure a proper discovery, reuse, and analysis of the research data. The first LTE, of which research data are published for free reuse through BonaRes, is the “V140” (1963–today) from Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF), Müncheberg, Germany.},

Long-term field experiments were used for this investigations as changes in soil organic matter content need more than 30 years. Soil organic matter fractions different in stability were isolated by sequential extraction, assuming that the water soluble fraction represents the unstable and the sodium pyrophosphate soluble fraction a stable part of soil organic matter. The amount of the isolated fractions were quantified and compared with the corresponding stable C-pool (HUM) simulated with the C-turnover model ROTH-C. Fourier Transform Infrared spectra of the soil organic matter fractions show that their composition is influenced by different long-term fertilization. The observed difference in soil organic matter composition is related to their sorption properties. Therefore, the isolation of the different soil organic matter fractions allows on one hand the validation of C-pools simulated with a carbon turnover model and gives on the other hand information on changes in their sorption behavior related to their composition due to changes in management.},

Soils: The investigations showed that organic manuring in combination with mineral N fertilization are main measures to ensure optimal carbon contents in soil. Quantity (amount of SOM) and quality (molecular weight, functionality) are influenced by management.

Water, atmosphere: N surplus due to high amounts of fertilizer is the primary cause of increased NO3concentration in soil and enhanced N2O emissions from N‐fertilized fields. A successful N2O mitigation strategy is achieved by a management directed to provide N at the time and place required by the plant to optimize growth and decrease the amount of N that is lost from the soil‐plant system.},

Accelerated CO2 concentrations are associated with higher temperatures entailing negative effects on soils. The reduction Of SO2 emissions has a major effect on the productivity of agricultural crops (yield losses, reduced natural resistance, increased non point N losses, increase of surface ozone concentration). N depositions contribute indirectly to N2O emission through an increased amount of N in the nutrient balance. Deposition of ammonia compounds is a primary cause of soil acidification.

	abstract = {Long-term soil hydrological studies were carried out at the ZALF Muencheberg Experimental Station. Muencheberg is located in a Pleistocene end moraine landscape in NE Germany about 50 km east of Berlin and 40 km west of the Oder river, the border with Poland. The soils are formed on Pleistocene parent material, classified as Haplic Albeluvisol with a Bt horizon mostly beginning at about 70 cm depth. From 1994-1999 the site was used as arable land managed by different farming systems (integrated, integrated with irrigation, ecological and low input). From 2000 to 2005 the effect of different tillage systems (plough and no till) was investigated. Furthermore, soil water was extracted by use of suction cups for analysing the soil water nitrate concentrations. The data were used for quantifying deep drainage rates and nitrate losses as described in (Schindler and Mueller, 2008 and Schindler et al., 2010). All basic data (soil water content, tension, precipitation, potential evapotranspiration and soil water nitrate concentrations) are accessible via DOI 10.4228/ZALF.1995.282.},
