              Mid‐term (MTEs, 5–20 years) and long‐term (LTEs, 20+ years) field experiments are key sources of information to design future climate‐smart agriculture. Within the European Joint Program SOIL (EJP SOIL), we built the EJP SOIL‐MTE/LTE metadataset that contains metadata from 240 MTEs/LTEs across Europe. Metadata collected included precise descriptions of the treatments (combination of factors such as tillage, crop type/rotation, amendments/fertilizers, grazing and pest/weed management), soil and crop measurements and pedo‐climatic information. Using different figures and dashboards, an overview of those MTEs/LTEs is presented and specific research themes (tillage systems, residue management, amendment type and cover crops) are further analysed within their pedo‐climatic context. An interactive web portal developed in collaboration with the BonaRes project (
              https://lte.bonares.de
              ), enables users to explore the metadataset and find relevant MTEs/LTEs for specific combinations of practices (e.g. all MTEs/LTEs that investigate cover crops on a Cambisol in no‐tillage system). Finally, a SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) analysis of the metadataset was carried out to highlight the potential contribution of MTEs/LTEs to a harmonized European soil observation and monitoring approach. We propose that the metadataset could be elaborated with metadata from other existing MTEs/LTEs in Europe or even worldwide.},

                Long‐term experiments (LTEs) have provided data to modellers and agronomists to investigate changes and dynamics of soil organic carbon (SOC) under different cropping systems. As treatment changes have occurred due to agricultural advancements, so too have analytical soil methods. This may lead to method bias over time, which could affect the robust interpretation of data and conclusions drawn. This study aims to quantify differences in SOC due to changes in dry combustion methods over time, using soil samples of a LTE established in 1963 that focuses on mineral and organic fertilizer management in the temperate zone of Northeast Germany. For this purpose, 1059 soil samples, collected between 1976 and 2008, have been analysed twice, once with their historical laboratory method right after sampling, and a second time in 2016 when all samples were analysed using the same elementary analyser. In 9 of 11 soil sampling campaigns, a paired
                t
                ‐test provided evidence for significant differences in the historical SOC values when compared with the re‐analysed concentrations of the same LTE sample. In the sampling years 1988 and 2004, the historical analysis obtained about 0.9 g kg
                −1
                lower SOC compared with the re‐analysed one. For 1990 and 1998, this difference was about 0.4 g kg
                −1
                . Correction factors, an approach often used to correct for different analytical techniques, could only be applied for 5 of 11 sampling campaigns to account for constant and proportional systematic method error. For this particular LTE, the interpretation of SOC changes due to agronomic management (here fertilization) deviates depending on the analytical method used, which may weaken the explanatory power of the historical data. We demonstrate that analytical method changes over time present one of many challenges in the interpretation of time series data of SOC dynamics. Therefore, LTE site managers need to ensure providing all necessary protocols and data in order to retrace method changes and if necessary recalculate SOC.

These models can be used to estimate future plant growth under different climate and management scenarios to support decision-making processes. The current study analyzed cereal grain yield responses to fertilizer management in sandy soil in a LTFE (1971 to 2016) in Northeast Germany. The objectives of this study were to a) analyze yield responses of spring barley), winter rye, and winter wheat to fertilizer management, b) analyze the sensitivity of yield responses to timing of weather events, and c) compare different analysis models. The study revealed that cereal yield response to fertilizer management was influenced by complex relationships among climatic dependence, preceding crop, and soil characteristics. Weather conditions at seeding and early growth stages of cereal were found to be sensitive to grain yield. For winter cereals, the intensity and duration of extreme temperatures in the summertime (harvest year), especially the number of days recorded with a maximum temperature above 30°C in July was an important variable for the yield. Among the investigated models, LMM-model had a better predictive performance compared to M5P-model and both had richer regressors than the ANOVA and BMA-model. The M5P-model presented an intuitive visualization of important variables and their critical thresholds, and revealed other variables that were not captured by the LMM-model. The findings of this analysis contribute to comprehensive strategies for sustainable crop production with regard to future climate change.},

                Soils store vast amounts of carbon (C) on land, and increasing soil organic carbon (
                SOC
                ) stocks in already managed soils such as croplands may be one way to remove C from the atmosphere, thereby limiting subsequent warming. The main objective of this study was to estimate the amount of additional C input needed to annually increase
                SOC
                stocks by 4‰ at 16 long‐term agricultural experiments in Europe, including exogenous organic matter (
                EOM
                ) additions. We used an ensemble of six
                SOC
                models and ran them under two configurations: (1) with default parametrization and (2) with parameters calibrated site‐by‐site to fit the evolution of
                SOC
                stocks in the control treatments (without
                EOM
                ). We compared model simulations and analysed the factors generating variability across models. The calibrated ensemble was able to reproduce the
                SOC
                stock evolution in the unfertilised control treatments. We found that, on average, the experimental sites needed an additional 1.5 ± 1.2 Mg C ha

                −1
                to increase
                SOC
                stocks by 4‰ per year over 30 years, compared to the C input in the control treatments (multi‐model median ± median standard deviation across sites). That is, a 119\% increase compared to the control. While mean annual temperature, initial
                SOC
                stocks and initial C input had a significant effect on the variability of the predicted C input in the default configuration (i.e., the relative standard deviation of the predicted C input from the mean), only water‐related variables (i.e., mean annual precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) explained the divergence between models when calibrated. Our work highlights the challenge of increasing
                SOC
                stocks in agriculture and accentuates the need to increasingly lean on multi‐model ensembles when predicting
                SOC
                stock trends and related processes. To increase the reliability of
                SOC
                models under future climate change, we suggest model developers to better constrain the effect of water‐related variables on
                SOC

              Sustainable agricultural land use requires an assessment of degradable soil organic matter (SOM) because of its key function for soil fertility and plant nutrition. Such an assessment for practical land use should consider transformation processes of SOM and its sources of different origin. In this study, we combined a 120‐day incubation experiment with thermal decay dynamics of agricultural soils altered by added organic amendments. The aim was to determine the abilities and limits of thermal analysis as a rapid approach revealing differences in the degradability of SOM. The carried out experiments based on two independent sampling sets. The first sample set consisted of soil samples taken from non‐fertilized plots of three German long‐term agricultural field experiments (LTAEs), then artificially mixed with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal equal to 60 Mg ha
              −1
              under laboratory conditions. The second sample set based on soil samples of different treatments (
              e.g
              ., crop type, fertilization, cultivation) in LTAEs at Bad Lauchstädt and Müncheberg, Germany. Before and after the incubation experiment, thermal mass losses (TML) at selected temperatures were determined by thermogravimetry indicating the degradability of organic amendments mixed in soils. The results confirmed different microbial degradability of organic amendments and SOM under laboratory conditions. Thermal decay dynamics revealed incubation‐induced changes in the artificial soil mixtures primarily at TML around 300°C in the case of applied straw and sheep faeces, whereas farmyard manure showed mainly changes in TML around 450°C. Charcoal did not show significant degradation during incubation, which was confirmed by TML. Detailed analyses of the artificial soil mixtures revealed close correlations between CO

              {\textgreater} 0.96. Results of the soils from LTAEs showed similar incubation‐induced changes in thermal decay dynamics for fresh plant residues and farmyard manure. We conclude that the practical assessment of SOM could be facilitated by thermal decay dynamics if modified sample preparation and evaluation algorithms are used beyond traditional peak analysis.},

Within this 22-year period, time spans with a better model performance and periods with a lower goodness of fit between simulations and observations were observed.

              Sustainable soil management requires reliable and accurate monitoring of changes in soil organic matter (SOM). However, despite the development of improved analytical techniques during the last decades, there are still limits in the detection of small changes in soil organic carbon content and SOM composition. This study focused on the detection of such changes under laboratory conditions by adding different organic amendments to soils. The model experiments consisted of artificially mixing soil samples from non‐fertilized plots of three German long‐term agricultural experiments in Bad Lauchstädt (silty loam), Grossbeeren (silty sand), and Müncheberg (loamy sand) with straw, farmyard manure, sheep faeces, and charcoal in quantities from 3 to 180 t ha
              −1
              each. In these mixtures we determined the organic carbon contents by elemental analysis and by thermal mass losses (TML) determined by thermogravimetry. The results confirmed the higher reliability of elemental analysis compared to TML for organic carbon content determination. The sensitivity of both methods was not sufficient to detect the changes in organic carbon content caused by small quantities of organic amendments (3 t ha
              −1
              or 0.1–0.4 g C kg
              −1
              soil). In the case of elemental analysis, the detectability of changes in carbon content increased with quantities of added amendments, but the method could not distinguish different types of organic amendments. On the contrary, the based on analysis of degradation temperatures, the TML allowed this discrimination together with their quantitative analysis. For example, added charcoal was not visible in TML from 320 to 330°C, which is used for carbon content determination. However, increasing quantities of charcoal were reflected in a higher TML around 520°C. Furthermore, differences between measured (with TML
              110–550
              ) and predicted mass loss on ignition using both organic carbon (with TML
              330
              ) and clay contents (with TML
              140
              ) were confirmed as a suitable indicator for detection of organic amendments in different types of soils. We conclude that thermogravimetry enables the sensitive detection of organic fertilizers and organic amendments in soils under arable land use.},

              The composition of soil organic matter (SOM) is influenced by land use and fertilization. We studied changes in the SOM in a long‐term field experiment on a sandy Podzoluvisol. The control plot and four combinations of manurial treatments of the experiment were selected: one with mineral fertilizer only and three combinations of organic manure with mineral fertilizer: cattle manure + NPK, cattle manure + PK and straw + NPK. The SOM was extracted by sodium pyrophosphate solution (pH = 10) and hot water (100°C). The extracts were analysed by Fourier‐Transform Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy and gel permeation chromatography (GPC). The FT‐IR spectra from sodium pyrophosphate extracts indicate that composition of SOM is indeed influenced by different fertilization. The C=O band at 1710 cm
              –1
              in the samples of the plots fertilized with cattle manure has the highest absorption intensity, whereas the material from the plot fertilized with straw + NPK has the least intense. The GPC analyses of the extracts showed that adding cattle manure + NPK increased the molecular size of SOM in comparison with the control plot. The analysis of hot‐water extracts with FT‐IR showed no significant differences in functional groups, but GPC chromatograms distinguished features in molecular size distribution. Fertilization with cattle manure increased the molecular size of the SOM in comparison with the control, but the differences in content of carboxylic groups and molecular weight were detected in sodium pyrophosphate extracts only.},

              Using data from long‐term experiments at the Loess‐Chernozem site, Bad Lauchstädt und 12 other European sites, the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) dynamics in soils, the determination of decomposable soil organic matter (SOM), the effect on yield of SOM as well as carbon and nitrogen balances are discussed. Both C and N in SOM have to be divided into an inert and a decomposable fraction. The inert C is strongly correlated with clay content, while most changes in both C and N occur in the readily decomposable fraction. In the experiments considered the latter ranges between 0.2 to 0.6\% C and 0.02 to 0.06\% N. The annual changes of the C
              org
              content amount only to about 0.01\% C
              org
              corresponding to 500 kg/ha, even under extreme changes of the fertilizing system.
            
            
              Hot water extractable C (C
              hwe
              ) has proved to be an appropriate criterion for the calculation of the decomposable C and thus for the N release from soil. Different methods to maintain a SOM balance are compared and first guideline values for an agronomically and ecologically justified SOM content of arable soils are recommended. In arable soils the exceeding of an upper C
              org
              value influences neither crop yield nor the C and N balance in a positive way. In terms of ecology and environment, set‐aside‐programmes or fallows in a crop rotation affect the balances negatively. Atmospheric N deposition can amount to about 50 kg/ha·yr.

              Die Umsetzung der organischen Bodensubstanz (OBS) und deren Langzeitbilanz — ein Weg zur Bewertung der Produktivität und Nachhaltigkeit von Böden
            
            
              Auf der Grundlage von Dauerfeldversuchsergebnissen auf dem Löß‐Schwarzerdestandort Bad Lauchstädt und 12 weiteren Standorten werden Aussagen zur C‐ und N‐Dynamik im Boden, zur Bestimmung des umsetzbaren Anteils der OBS, zur Ertragswirksamkeit sowie zur Bilanzierung von C und N abgeleitet. Hierbei wird zwischen inertem und umsetzbarem Kohlenstoff bzw. Stickstoff unterschieden. Der inerte C ist sehr eng mit dem Tongehalt korreliert. Veränderungen in der OBS betreffen nahezu ausschließlich den umsetzbaren Anteil. Dieser macht unter den untersuchten Bedingungen 0.2 bis 0.6\% C

              bzw. 0.02 bis 0.06\% N, aus. Die jährlichen Veränderungen im C

            Der heißwasserlösliche Kohlenstoff hat sich als ein geeignetes Kriterium für den umsetzbaren C und damit für die N‐Nachlieferung erwiesen. Es werden unterschiedliche Methoden der Bilanzierung der OBS verglichen und erste Orientierungswerte für den Gehalt des Bodens an OBS mitgeteilt. Auf ackerbaulich genutzten Standorten werden bei Überschreiten dieser Orientierungswerte weder die Erträge, noch die C‐ und N‐Bilanzen positiv beeinflußt. Brache und Flächenstillegungen wirken sich ungünstig auf den C‐ und N‐Kreislauf aus. Die atmosphärische N‐Deposition kann mit {\textgreater} 50 kg/ha a angesetzt werden.},

The SOM and hot‐water‐soluble and pyrophosphate‐soluble (OM‐PY) organic matter fractions were analyzed using Fourier‐transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The OM composition was evaluated in terms of the ratio between absorption band intensities in FTIR. The soluble OM fractions of FYM had larger C=O/C–O–C ratios than the N and control treatments. While the cation exchange capacity (CEC) of OM‐PY from FYM was larger, it was smaller for the N plots than the control at all sites. The results allowed identification of fertilization‐induced long‐term dynamics in (i) the OM composition and (ii) the CEC and the potential wettability of SOM and OM fractions. The OM‐PY fraction could be used to identify and characterize the long‐term changes in OM composition. For a more quantitative analysis, however, more replicate samples and a seasonal differentiation would be required to separate between shorter and longer term changes.},

	title = {Impact of air pollutants on agriculture},
	abstract = {Air pollutants change plant metabolism, yield, crop quality, soil fertility, temperature regimes and hydrology. Type of air pollutants, deposition rate and structure of ecosystem bias the effects on agriculture. Increased CO2 concentrations generally cause positive effects through increased root mass, litter and crop residues thereby increasing soil organic matter and plant growth. Accelerated CO2 concentrations are associated with higher temperatures causing negative effects on soils. The reduction of SO2 emissions has a major effect on the productivity of agricultural crops (yield losses, reduced natural resistance, increased non-point N losses, increase of surface ozone concentration). N depositions contribute indirectly to N2O emission through an increased amount of N in the nutrient balance. Deposition of ammonia compounds is a primary cause of soil acidification. Ammonia contributes to transboundary air pollution and nitrogen enrichment of nutrient-poor soils. Air pollutants affect agriculture and may endanger a sustainable crop production. This is inconsistent with the requirement to protect the natural resources soil, water, atmosphere, and energy.},
